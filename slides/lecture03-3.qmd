# Review and Questions

## Last Class

- Model-based simulation as a way to understand system dynamics and response.
- Box models: mass-balance in some region of the domain
- Can generalize single box models by:
    - Adding more complexity;
    - combining multiple boxes.

## Why Simulate?

1. System involves complex, nonlinear dynamics that may not be analytically tractable.
2. Setting up and running a real-world experiment is not possible.
3. State depends on prior states or states of nearby locations, so need to iterate over multiple spatial or temporal steps.
4. Need to understand range of system performance across rarely-seen conditions.  

## Questions

# Dissolved Oxygen Overview

## Fate & Transport Modeling

**How do nutrients and other quantities move through environmental mediums?**

What can make fate & transport modeling more complex?

::: {.fragment .fade-in}
- Multiple points of inflow;
- More complex growth/decay dynamics.
- Stochasticity/randomness.

## Dissolved Oxygen

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width=50%}
Dissolved oxygen (DO) is the free, non-compound oxygen present in water or other liquids.

Freshwater can only hold small amounts, and this capacity is regulated by temperature.

Dissolved oxygen is an important nutrient for aquatic life.

## DO Regulatory Standards

**Objective**: Keep DO *above* the regulatory standard.

In NY (via [Westlaw](https://govt.westlaw.com/nycrr/Document/I4ed90412cd1711dda432a117e6e0f345?viewType=FullText&originationContext=documenttoc&transitionType=CategoryPageItem&contextData=(sc.Default)&bhcp=1)): 

- DO levels may not fall below 3 mg/L
- DO may not be below 4.8 mg/L for an extended period

## Selecting a Metric for DO Fluxes

Typically use **oxygen demand** (OD): 

- measure of the concentration of oxidizable materials in a water sample
- metric for organic waste contamination
- reflects how oxygen will be depleted in a given segment

But there are several different processes affecting total OD!

## Biochemical Oxygen Demand (BOD)

Oxygen used by microbes during aerobic decomposition of organic materials:
$$\text{Organic Matter} + \text{O}_2 \rightarrow \text{CO}_2 +  \text{H}_2\text{O} + \text{NO}_3 + \text{SO}_2 + \text{Residuals}$$

Broadly speaking, we care about two types of BOD: **Carbonaceous BOD** and **Nitrogenous BOD**.

## Carbonaceous BOD (CBOD)

Oxygen consumed during microbial decomposition of carbon compounds, *e.g.*:
$$\text{C}_a\text{H}_b\text{O}_c + d\text{O}_2 \rightarrow e\text{H}_2\text{O} + f\text{CO}_2$$

## Nitrogenous BOD (NBOD)

Oxygen consumed during microbial decomposition of nitrogen compounds:
$$2\text{NH}_2^+ + 4\text{O}_2 \rightarrow 2\text{H}_2\text{O} + 4\text{H}^+ + 2\text{NO}_3^-$$

## BOD and Time

Moreover, BOD is differentiated based on time frame, *e.g.*:

- BOD<sub>5</sub>: oxygen demand over 5 days
- BOD<sub>20</sub>: oxygen demand over 20 days

## DO Modeling Needs

Need a model that will predict DO as a function of CBOD, NBOD.

Use a *fate and transport* modeling approach: how are relevant quantities moved downstream?

**Note**: Can't assume homogeneous processes.

## Modeling DO

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width=30%}
So what do we do?

Start by assuming *steady-state* waste in each section (or box...).

We'll track the mass balance in terms of rates (not absolute mass).

## Steady-State Waste, DO Mass Balance

Let $U$ be the river velocity (km/d), $x$ the distance downstream from a waste release site in km, and $C(x)$ the DO concentration at $x$ in mg/L. 

\begin{align}
U \frac{dC}{dx} &= \text{Change in DO} \\[0.5em]
&= \text{Reaeration} + \text{Photosynthesis} - \text{Respiration}  \\[0.5em]
& \qquad - \text{Benthal Uptake} - \text{CBOD} - \text{NBOD}

\end{align}

## BOD Oxygen Uptake

Assume deoxygenation from waste decomposition is first-order (rate $k$):

$$\begin{aligned}
\frac{dM}{dt} &= -kM \\\\
\Rightarrow M &= M_0 \exp(-kt)
\end{aligned}$$


::: {.fragment .fade-in}
But our equations are formulated in terms of distance:

$$M = M_0 \exp(-kx/U)$$

:::


## BOD Oxygen Uptake

For biochemical organics, if $k_c$ is the deoxygenation rate (d$^{-1}$);

$$B(x) = B_0 \exp(-k_c x / U);$$

For nitrification, if $k_n$ is the deoxygenation rate (d$^{-1}$):

$$N(x) = N_0 \exp(-k_n x / U).$$

## Steady-State Waste, DO Mass Balance

So the corresponding oxygen uptake rates are 
$$k_c B(x) = k_c B_0 \exp(-k_c x / U)$$
 and 

 $$k_n N(x) = k_n N_0 \exp(-k_n x / U).$$


## Steady-State Waste, DO Mass Balance

Other processes:

- Reaeration, assume a simple linear model based on difference from saturation level $C_s$: $k_a (C_s - C)$

- Assume measured, constant values for photosynthesis ($P_s$), respiration ($R$), benthal uptake ($S_B$)

## Steady-State Waste, DO Mass Balance

Putting it all together:

$$\begin{aligned}
U \frac{dC}{dx} &= k_a (C_s - C) + P - R - S_B \\\\
&\quad - k_cB_0\exp\left(\frac{-k_cx}{U}\right) - k_n N_0\exp\left(\frac{-k_nx}{U}\right)
\end{aligned}$$
