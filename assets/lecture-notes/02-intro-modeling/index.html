# What Is *Not* a System?


<hr>


We don't need a systems approach when components can be treated individually, e.g., *the whole is no more than the sum of its parts*.


**Can we think of some examples?**

# An Example!


<hr>


.center[![Diagram of CRUD release from two factories](figures/river_diagram.png)]


{{content}}


---


Two factories are discharging a chemical, *chlororadiated ureadicarboxyl* (CRUD), into the Riley River. 


---


Environmental authorities have sampled water from the river and determined that concentrations exceed the legal standard (1 mg/L). 


---


We want to design a CRUD removal plan to get back in compliance.


**Where do we start? What do we need to know?**


---


class: left


layout: false






# What We Know About CRUD


<hr>


  * CRUD decays in the river with first-order decay coefficient $k=0.45 \ \text{d}^{-1}$.


--


  * Treating CRUD costs $ \$50 E^2 \text{ per } 1000 \  m^3,$ where $E$ is the treatment efficiency.
  * If $E_i$ is the treatment efficiency at factory $i$, the total treatment cost is


$$
C(E_1, E_2) = 50(100)E_1^2 + 50(60)E_2^2.
$$

# How Much To Remove?


<hr>


Consider the problem at each point of release.

{{content}}


---


(recall that $1 \ \text{mg/L} = 1 \ \text{g/m}^3 = 10^{-3} \ \text{kg/m}^3$)


---


1. What is the inflow? What is the outflow for a given $E_i$?
2. How does this impact the concentration downstream?


---

layout: false






# Mass Balance at Release 1


<hr>


.center[![](figures/crud-release-1.svg)]


--


Factory 1 releases $100 \ \text{kg/d}$ without treatment.


**What is the outflow for a given $E_1$?**


---


class: left




# Mass Balance at Release 1


<hr>


.center[![](figures/crud-release-1-treated.svg)]


--


Total CRUD after factory 1 release: $\color{blue}\text{100} + \color{red} 1000(1-E_1) \color{black} \ \text{kg/d}$


---


class: left






# Mass Balance at Release 2


<hr>


.center[![](figures/crud-release-1-total.svg)]


--


But this isn't the inflow for release 2...


---

# Mass Decay


<hr>


Given a decay rate of $k = 0.45 \ \text{d}^{-1}$:


$$
\frac{dM}{dt} = -0.45 M \Rightarrow \frac{dM}{M} = -0.45 dt
$$


$$
\int_{M(0)}^{M(T)} \frac{dM}{M} = -0.45 \int_0^T dt
$$


$$
\ln\left(\frac{M(T)}{M(0)}\right) = -0.45 T
$$


$$
M(T) = M(0) \exp\left(-0.45 T\right)
$$


---


class: left




# Mass Decay


<hr>


So now we know that after $t$ days,  $M(t) = M_0 \exp \left(-0.45 T \right).$


--


But we want to know $M(x)$, where $x$ is in distance, since we know the distance between factories 1 and 2 is $10 \ \text{km}$. 


---


class: left




# Mass Decay


<hr>


Since the velocity of the river is $25 \ \text{km/d}$:


$$
M(x) = M_0 \exp\left(-0.45 (x/25)\right), \quad x \leq 10 \ \text{km},
$$


and simplifying and plugging in $x = 10$ and $M_0$, the inflow of CRUD at the factory 2 release is:


$$
M(10) = (1100 - 1000E_1) \exp(-0.18) \ \text{kg/d}.
$$

# Mass Balance at Release 2


<hr>


.center[![](figures/crud-release-2.svg)]

class: left




# Mass Balance at Release 2


<hr>


.center[![](figures/crud-release-2-treated.svg)]


This means that after factory 2 releases CRUD, the concentration is:


$$
(1100 - 1000E_1) \exp(-0.18) + 1200(1 - E_2) \ \text{kg/d}.
$$


---


class: left




# Mass Balance at Release 2


<hr>


.center[![](figures/crud-release-2-treated.svg)]


We can use this as an initial condition for $M(x), x > 10$:


$$
M(x) = M_1 \exp\left(-0.45 (x/25)\right), \quad x > 10,
$$


where $M_1 = (1100 - 1000E_1) \exp(-0.18) + 1200(1 - E_2)$.

# ...Now What?


<hr>


Our next steps depend on what we're trying to do: is our model descriptive or prescriptive?


--


  * *Descriptive*: Use the dynamical equations to simulate concentrations for varying levels of $E_1, E_2$ and compare those to the costs and the legal limit.


--


  * *Prescriptive*: Turn these equations and limits into constraints and find the values of $E_1, E_2$ which minimize costs while staying in compliance (we'll return to this later!).

# Discussion of Oreskes et al (1994)


<hr>


> Models can corroborate a hypothesis by offering evidence to strengthen what may be already partly established through othermeans. Models can elucidate discrepancies in other models. Models can be also be used for sensitivity analysis –- for exploring "what if" questions –- thereby illuminating which aspects of the system are most in need of further study, and where more empirical data are most needed. **Thus, the primary value of models is heuristic: Models are representations, useful for guiding further study but not susceptible to proof.**

# "All Models Are Wrong, But Some Are Useful"


<hr>


> ...all models are approximations. Essentially, all models are wrong, but some are useful. However, the approximate nature of the model must always be borne in mind....
>
> .cite[– Box & Draper, 1987]



--


A key consideration: how do we check/ensure that models we use are useful? How do we know when they're not?

# A Leading Question


<hr>


Someone has developed a model of a complex process (say...number of cases of a particular infectious disease). They claim that their model has precisely predicted case counts for a few months, and use this to argue for the model's validity (and their skill as a modeler, presumably).


--


**Should we trust their claim? What might this imply about the model? Is it useful?**
