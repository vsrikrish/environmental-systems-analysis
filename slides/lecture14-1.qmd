# Review and Questions

## Sensitivity Analysis

- **Sensitivity Analysis**: How is uncertainty in the output(s) affected by uncertainty in the outputs?

## Types of Sensitivity Analysis

- One-At-A-Time vs. All-At-Once
- Local vs. Global

## Some Common Methods

- Perturbation/Derivatives (OAT, Local)
- Method of Morris (OAT, Global)
- Sobol' (OAT/All At Once, Global)
- Regression: Linear Regression, Tree-based, Logistic (OAT/All At Once, Global)

# Multiple Objectives

## Multiple Objectives and Environmental Systems

Often have multiple objectives at play when designing or managing environmental systems:

::: {.fragment .fade-in}
**Some examples**:

- Cost
- Environmental quality
- Reliability/Variability
:::

## Example: Power Systems

- Total generation cost (including reserves);
- CO~2~ emissions;
- Resource adequacy (do we have enough resources available);
- Reliability;
- Other environmental impacts

## Example: Reservoir Operations

- Municipal demand;
- Irrigation;
- Recreation;
- Hydropower potential;
- Flood management;
- Streamflow (ecosystem management)

## How Can We Incorporate Multiple Objectives Into Models?

Approaches are method specific!

Key Question: ***what does it mean to "optimize" multiple objectives?***

## How Can We Incorporate Multiple Objectives Into Models?

**Linear Programming**:

::: {.fragment .fade-in}
::: {.incremental}

1. Identify thresholds and establish constraints for non-objective "objectives";
2. Weight objectives based on preferences, *e.g.*
    $$\min_\mathbf{x} Z(\mathbf{x}) = \sum_i w_i \hat{Z_i}(\mathbf{x}), \qquad \sum_i w_i =1$$

:::

## How Can We Incorporate Multiple Objectives Into Models?

**Simulation-Optimization**:

- Could use the LP approaches
- Can also have the simulation model (or wrapper) return multiple metrics

## Back To The Key Question...

***What does it mean to "optimize" multiple objectives?***

::: {.fragment .fade-in}

Straightforward with weighting, requires but *a priori* elicitation of weights.

What about if we leave the objectives unaggregated?

:::

## Example: Lake Problem

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width=50%}
Simulated 100 random decisions with two objectives:

- Maximize mean P releases
- Minimize probability of exceeding critical P concentration
:::

::: {.column width=50%}
```{julia}
function lake(a, y, q, b, T)
    X = zeros(T+1, size(y, 2))
    # calculate states

    for t = 1:T
        X[t+1, :] = X[t, :] .+ a[t] .+ y[t, :] .+ (X[t, :].^q./(1 .+ X[t, :].^q)) .- b.*X[t, :]
    end
    return X
end

# set parameters and draw samples

T = 100
nsamp = 10_000
lnorm = LogNormal(log(0.03), 0.15)
y = rand(lnorm, (T, nsamp))
q = 2.5
b = 0.4
a = rand(Uniform(0.0, 0.05), (T, 100))

# find critical value
crit(x) = (x^q/(1+x^q)) - b*x
Xcrit = find_zero(crit, (0.1, 1.5))

# write wrapper to evaluate model and return outputs
function lake_eval(a, y, q, b, T, Xcrit)
    P = zeros(T+1, size(y, 2))
    for i = 1:size(y, 2)
        P[:, i] = lake(a, y[:, i], q, b, T)
    end
    return (mean(a), sum(P[101, :]) / size(P, 2))
end

lake_out = map(x -> lake_eval(x, y, q, b, T, Xcrit), eachslice(a; dims=2))
obj = DataFrame(mean_a = getindex.(lake_out, 1), worst_P = getindex.(lake_out, 2))

p_pareto = scatter(obj[:, 1], obj[:, 2], markersize=6, label="Candidate Decisions", tickfontsize=16, guidefontsize=18, legendfontsize=14, right_margin=10mm)
xlabel!("Mean P Release")
ylabel!("Probability of Eutrophication")
plot!(size=(600, 600))
xlims!(0.021, 0.03)
ylims!(0.10, 0.25)
```

## Tradeoffs

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width=50%}
There is a tradeoff between these two objectives:

Greater releases **typically** means lower reliability.

***What does it mean to find an "optimum" across these two objectives?***
:::

::: {.column width=50%}
```{julia}
annotate!(0.029, 0.17, text("Preferred Direction", color=:purple, pointsize=16, rotation=90))
annotate!(0.025, 0.11, text("Preferred Direction", color=:purple, pointsize=16))
quiver!([0.0225], [0.103], quiver=([0.0055], [0]), color=:purple, linewidth=5)
quiver!([0.0295], [0.215], quiver=([0], [-0.09]), color=:purple, linewidth=5)
```
:::

## Non-Dominated Decisions

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width=50%}
We say that a decision $\mathbf{x}$ is **dominated** if there exists another solution $\mathbf{y}$ such that for every objective metric $Z_i(\cdot)$, $$Z_i(\mathbf{x}) > Z_i(\mathbf{y}).$$
:::

::: {.column width=50%}
```{julia}
sort!(obj, rev=true)
pareto = obj[1:1, :]
foreach(row -> row[2] < pareto[end, 2] && push!(pareto, row), eachrow(obj));
scatter!(p_pareto, pareto[:, 1], pareto[:, 2], label="Non-Dominated Decisions", markersize=6, color=:orange)
```
:::
::::

## Non-Dominated Decisions

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width=50%}
$\mathbf{x}$ is **non-dominated** if it is not dominated by any $\mathbf{y} \neq \mathbf{x}$.
:::

::: {.column width=50%}
```{julia}
p_pareto
```
:::
::::


## Pareto Fronts

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width=50%}
The set of non-dominated solutions is called the **Pareto front** (solutions are **Pareto-optimal**).

Every member of a Pareto front represents a different tradeoff between objectives.

:::

::: {.column width=50%}
```{julia}
p_pareto
```
:::
::::

## *A Priori* vs *A Posteriori* Decision-Making

This gives us two frameworks for evaluating tradeoffs:

1. ***A Priori***: Establish weights ahead of time and combine objectives;
2. ***A Posteriori***: Identify Pareto-optimal solutions and then discuss what tradeoffs are tolerable.

## Identifying Pareto Fronts

In higher dimensions, manually screening of a Pareto front is difficult.

Can use **multi-objective optimization** with (certain) evolutionary algorithms.

# Key Takeaways

## Key Takeaways

- Management of environmental systems often involves multiple objectives.
- Multiple objectives often have tradeoffs.
- Can combine multiple objectives with weights (***a priori*** decision-making) or identifying non-dominated solutions (***a posteriori*** decision-making)
- Set of non-dominated solutions (**Pareto front**) represent different choices about tradeoffs.

# Course Review

## Recap of Topics

**Systems Dynamics and Models**

::: {.fragment .fade-in}
::: {.incremental}
- Nonlinear dynamics result in a need to view the entire system, not individual components.
- Models allow us to understand how a system could/would evolve under different conditions.
- No model is "right", results in a need to consider relevant uncertainties.

## Recap of Topics

**Simulating Systems**:

::: {.fragment .fade-in}
::: {.incremental}
- **Descriptive Modeling**: using a model to generate data about how a system would behave
- Typically involves looping over a domain (spatial or temporal) and evaluating
- "Box" models

- Power systems

**Key**: These methods require domain knowledge but are generally applicable to all environmental systems management or design problems.
