    "section": "Community",
    "text": "Community\n\nDiversity and Inclusion\nOur goal in this class is to foster an inclusive learning environment and make everyone feel comfortable in the classroom, regardless of social identity, background, and specific learning needs. As engineers, our work touches on many critical aspects of society, and questions of inclusion and social justice cannot be separated from considerations of systems analysis, objective selection, risk analysis, and trade-offs.\nIn all communications and interactions with each other, members of this class community (students and instructors) are expected to be respectful and inclusive. In this spirit, we ask all participants to:\n\nshare their experiences, values, and beliefs;\nbe open to and respectful of the views of others; and\nvalue each other’s opinions and communicate in a respectful manner.\n\nPlease let me know if you feel any aspect(s) of class could be made more inclusive. Please also share any preferred name(s) and/or your pronouns with me if you wish: I use he/him/his, and you can refer to me either as Vivek or Prof. Srikrishnan.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease, Be Excellent To Teach Other\n\n\n\nWe all make mistakes in our communications with one another, both when speaking and listening. Be mindful of how spoken or written language might be misunderstood, and be aware that, for a variety of reasons, how others perceive your words and actions may not be exactly how you intended them. At the same time, it is also essential that we be respectful and interpret each other’s comments and actions in good faith.\n\n\n\n\nStudent Accomodations\nLet me know if you have any access barriers in this course, whether they relate to course materials, assignments, or communications. If any special accomodations would help you navigate any barriers and improve your chances of success, please exercise your right to those accomodations and reach out to me as early as possible with your Student Disability Services (SDS) accomodation letter. This will ensure that we have enough time to make appropriate arrangements.\nIf you need more immediate accomodations, but do not yet have a letter, please let me know and then follow up with SDS.\n\n\nCourse Communications\nMost course communications will occur via Ed Discussion. Public Ed posts are generally preferred to private posts or emails, as other students can benefit from the discussions. If you would like to discuss something privately, please do reach out through email or a private Ed post (which will only be viewable by you and the course staff).\nAnnouncements will be made on the course website and in Ed. Emergency announcements will also be made on Canvas.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEd Tips\n\n\n\n\nIf you wait until the day an assignment is due (or even late the previous night) to ask a question on Ed, there is a strong chance that I will not see your post prior to the deadline.\nBut if you see unanswered questions and you have some insight, please answer! This class will work best when we all work together as a community.\n\n\n\n\n\nMental Health Resources\nWe all have to take care of our mental health, just as we would our physical health. As a student, you may experience a range of issues which can negatively impact your mental health. Please do not ignore any of these stressors, or feel like you have to navigate these challenges alone! You are part of a community of students, faculty, and staff, who have a responsibility to look for one another’s well-being. If you are struggling with managing your mental health, or if you believe a classmate may be struggling, please reach out to the course instructor, the TA, or, for broader support, please take advantage of Cornell’s mental health resources.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMental Health And This Class\n\n\n\nI am not a trained counselor, but I am here to support you in whatever capacity we can. You should never feel that you need to push yourself past your limits to complete any assignment for this class or any other. If we need to make modifications to the course or assignment schedule, you can certainly reach out to me, and all relevant discussions will be kept strictly confidential.",

    "section": "Course Policies",
    "text": "Course Policies\n\nAttendance\nAttendance is not required, but in general, students who attend class regularly will do better and get more out of the class than students who do not. Your class participation grade will reflect both the quantity and quality of your participation, only some of which can occur asynchronously. I will put as many course materials, such as lecture notes and announcements, as possible online, but viewing materials online is not the same as active participation and engagement. Life happens, of course, and this may lead you to miss class. Let me know if you need any appropriate arrangements ahead of time.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat If I’m Sick?\n\n\n\nPlease stay home if you’re feeling sick! This is beneficial for both for your own recovery and the health and safety of your classmates. We will also make any necessary arrangements for you to stay on top of the class material and if whatever is going on will negatively impact your grade, for example by causing you to be unable to submit an assignment on time.\n\n\n\n\nMask Policies\nMasks are encouraged but not required in the classroom, per university policy. However, the University strongly encourages compliance with requests to mask from students, faculty, and staff who are concerned about the risk of infection. Please be respectful of these concerns and requests if you cannot wear a mask.\n\n\nAcademic Integrity\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTL;DR: Don’t cheat, copy, or plagiarize!\n\n\n\nThis class is designed to encourage collaboration, and students are encouraged to discuss their work with other students. However, I expect students to abide by the Cornell University Code of Academic Integrity in all aspects of this class. All work submitted must represent the students’ own work and understanding, whether individually or as a group (depending on the particulars of the assignment). This includes analyses, code, software runs, and reports. Engineering as a profession relies upon the honesty and integrity of its practitioners (see e.g. the American Society for Civil Engineers’ Code of Ethics).\n\n\nExternal Resources\nThe collaborative environment in this class should not be viewed as an invitation for plagiarism. Plagiarism occurs when a writer intentionally misrepresents another’s words or ideas (including code!) as their own without acknowledging the source. All external resources which are consulted while working on an assignment should be referenced, including other students and faculty with whom the assignment is discussed. You will never be penalized for consulting an external source for help and referencing it, but plagiarism will result in a zero for that assignment as well as the potential for your case to be passed on for additional disciplinary action.\n\n\nAI/ML Resource Policy\nAs noted, all work submitted for a grade in this course must reflect your own understanding. The use and consulation of AI/ML tools, such as ChatGPT or similar, must be pre-approved and clearly referenced. If approved, you must:\n\nreference the URL of the service you are using, including the specific date you accessed it;\nprovide the exact query or queries used to interact with the tool; and\nreport the exact response received.\n\nFailure to attain prior approval or fully reference the interaction, as described above, will be treated as plagiarism and referred to the University accordingly.\n\n\nLate Work Policy\nIn general, late work will be subjected to a 10% penalty per day, which can accumulate to 100% of the total grade. However, sometimes things come up in life. Please reach out ahead of time if you have extenuating circumstances (including University-approved absences or illnesses) which would make it difficult for you to submit your work on time. Work which would be late for appropriate reasons will be given extensions and the late penalty will be waived.",

    "text": "Assessments\n\nLab Notebooks: 20%\nSome classes will involve hands-on exercises (which we will call “labs”) which will give you guided practice applying the concepts and methods from class. These classes will be announced on the course website ahead of time so anyone who is able can bring a laptop to class, and notebooks will be provided on GitHub. These labs can be done in groups; if you cannot bring a laptop to class for whatever reason, you will be able to (and are encouraged to) work with other students, though you must turn in your own notebook for grading.\nSome details on lab logistics:\n\nSome of the labs may some time outside of class, but they will not be as intensive as a homework assignment.\nYou will be required to submit a PDF of your completed notebook to Gradescope by 9:00pm by the due date (which will be approximately one week) after the lab session. Tag the answers to each question: points will be deducted if this is not done.\nWhile your lowest lab grade will not be dropped, late penalties will be waived for appropriate reasons discussed with the instructor (ideally ahead of time when circumstances allow).\nRubrics will be provided for lab grading as part of the lab assignments.\n\n\n\nHomework Assignments: 40%\nApproximately 5-6 homework assignments will be assigned throughout the semester; the specifics depend on how quickly we move through the material. You will typically have 10 days to 2 weeks to work on Students are encouraged to collaborate and learn from each other on homework assignments, but each student must submit their own solutions reflecting their understanding of the material. Consulting and referencing external resources and your peers is encouraged (engineering is a collaborative discipline!), but plagiarism is a violation of academic integrity.\nSome notes on assignment and grading logistics:\n\nHomework assignments will be distributed using GitHub Classroom. Students should make sure they update their GitHub repositories as they work on the assignments; this helps with answering questions and gives you a backstop in case something goes wrong and you can’t submit your assignment on time.\nHomeworks are due by 9:00pm Eastern Time on the designed due date. Your assignment notebook (which include your writeup and codes) should be submitted to Gradescope as a PDF with the answers to each question tagged (a failure to do this will result in deductions).\nRubrics will be provided for the homeworks as part of the assignments.\nYour lowest homework grade will be dropped. We can discuss arrangements if multiple assignments will be missed for university-approved reasons, preferably ahead of time.\nRegrade requests for specific problems must be made within a week of the grading of that assignment. However, note that regrades can cut both ways: the TA can take away points as well!\n\n\n\nFinal Term Project: 40%\nThis course will culminate with a term project with a topic selected from a suggested list (provided mid-semester). The goal of this project is to apply and extend the tools and approaches we will learn in class. While we encourage drawing on other classes or interests when developing and working on your project, submitting work from another course or work which was completed prior to the course is not permitted.\nThe term project will be completed in small groups (2-3 students) for students enrolled in BEE 4750 and individually for those in BEE 5750. The final deliverable for this project will be a poster summarizing the project and results. Ahead of that, you will submit the following:\n\na proposal for feedback on the scope of your project; and\na 2-3 page report on the status and history of a regulation of interest relevant to the system you are studying.\n\nRubrics will be provided for the components of the project.",

Jenkins and Michael R. Davidson.\nJuMP (“Julia for Mathematical Programming”) is an open-source Julia package that adds functionality for formulating and solving a variety of optimization problems. One advantage of JuMP is that its syntax matches the typical mathematical formalism used to specify optimization problems. We will use JuMP in this class for our optimization work.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRead the Documentation!\n\n\n\nMake sure that you take a look at the JuMP documentation whenever you have a question or want to find out how to do something that we don’t discuss in any of our tutorials or lectures (or how to do it better!).",

You will also need to select a solver and install the relevant package. Some of these are commercial, while others are open source. Solvers are also not typically universal, as different types of optimization problems use different algorithms, so be aware of what problem you’re trying to solve instead of just blindly copying code from one task to another.\nFor example, for the linear programming example, we will use the HiGHS solver via the HiGHS.jl package. As seen on the solver table, HiGHS is open source (via the MIT license) and can solve linear programs (LP) and mixed-integer linear programs (MILP), as well as quadratic programs (which we won’t discuss in this course).",

    "text": "Linear Programming Example: How Many Widgets Should A Factory Produce?\n\nDefining The Problem\nSuppose we own a factory that can produce two types of widgets:\n\nWidget A generates a profit of \\(p_A = \\$100\\) per widget; and\nWidget B generates a profit of \\(p_B = \\$75\\) per widget.\n\nLet \\(x\\) be the number of units of widget A that we want to produce, and \\(y\\) the number of units of widget B. Our goal is to maximize our total profit \\(p_Ax + p_By\\). This is the objective function. We express this objective using the equation \\[\\begin{equation}\n\\max_{x, y} 100x + 75y. \\label{eq:objective}\n\\end{equation}\\]\nThis isn’t a very interesting problem yet! We would simply build as much of both widgets as we could, because there are no constraints on our ability to produce. To make this more realistic, let’s suppose that both widgets are produced using the same raw material \\(M\\), of which we can only procure 300 units. Then, if:\n\nWidget A requires 40 units of \\(M\\) per widget, and\nWidget B requires 20 units of \\(M\\) per widget, we arrive at the following material constraint: \\[\\begin{equation}\n40x + 20y \\leq 300. \\label{eq:constraint1}\n\\end{equation}\\]\n\nBut we might have another constraint: time! Each widget may take a different amount of labor to produce. For example, let’s say that\n\nWidget A takes 6 hours to produce and\nWidget B takes 12 hours to produce. Further, there are only 80 hours per work that can be allocated to widget production. This becomes the time constraint \\[\\begin{equation}\n6x + 12y \\leq 80. \\label{eq:constraint2}\n\\end{equation}\\]\n\nFinally, we cannot build a negative number of either type of widget. This is known as a non-negativity constraint, and can be expressed as\n\\[\\begin{align}\nx &\\geq 0 \\label{eq:constraintx} \\\\\ny &\\geq 0 \\label{eq:constrainty}\n\\end{align}\\]\nConsolidating equations \\(\\eqref{eq:objective}\\)–\\(\\eqref{eq:constrainty}\\) gives us the following constrained optimization problem:\n\\[\\begin{equation}\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\max_{x, y} & 100x + 75y\\\\\n&\\text{subject to} & \\\\\n& & 40x + 20y \\leq 300\\\\\n& & 6x + 12y \\leq 80\\\\\n& & x \\geq 0\\\\\n& & y \\geq 0\n\\end{aligned} \\label{eq:widget}\n\\end{equation}\\]\n\n\nVisualizing the Problem\nLet’s do some plotting to examine the geometry of our optimization problem. We can do this using the Plots.jl package in Julia.\n\n## set up objective function parameters and variables\npa = 100\npb = 75\na = range(0, 8, step=0.25)\nb = range(0, 8, step=0.25)\n\n## define objective function\nf(a, b) = pa * a + pb * b\n\n## start plotting\ncontour(a,b,(a,b)-&gt;f(a,b),nlevels=15, c=:heat, linewidth=10, colorbar = false, contour_labels = true) # objective function contours\ntitle!(\"Factory Optimization Problem\") # add title\nxaxis!(\"x=Widget A\", lims=(0, maximum(a))) # add x-axis title and limits\nyaxis!(\"y=Widget B\", lims=(0, maximum(b))) # add y-axis title and limits\nxticks!(0:maximum(a)) # set x-axis ticks\nyticks!(0:maximum(b)) # set y-axis ticks\nareaplot!(a[a.&lt;=11], (300 .- 40*a)./20, legend=false, opacity=0.3) # plot materials constraint feasible region\nareaplot!(a[a.&lt;=8], (80 .- 6*a)./12, legend=false, opacity=0.3) # plot time constraint feasible region\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n    \n  \n\n\n\n  \n    \n  \n\n\n\n  \n    \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Decision space for the widget linear program \\(\\eqref{eq:widget}\\).

    "section": "Solving This Problem Using JuMP",
    "text": "Solving This Problem Using JuMP\n\nSetting Up the Model and Solver\nTo solve our problem, first we need to define the model. The model object has lots of attributes, including the variables, constraints, solver options, etc. We create a new model using the Model() function. Since we are using the HiGHS solver, we need to tell JuMP to use the HiGHS.Optimizer solver function.\n\nfactory_model = Model(HiGHS.Optimizer) \n\nThere are a bunch of attributes and options that we could set, but we won’t in this example. If needed, look at the HiGHS.jl documentation.\n\nDefine Variables\nDecision variables (\\(x\\) and \\(y\\) in this case) in JuMP are defined using the @variable macro. The first argument passed to @variable() is the model object, in this case, factory_model, and the second argument are bounds on that variable, created using &gt;= and &lt;=. JuMP will interpret the bound specification to obtain the variable name. In this case, our only bounds directly on the variables are the non-negativity constraints.\n\n@variable(factory_model, x &gt;= 0)\n@variable(factory_model, y &gt;= 0)\n\nIf we had a free (or unbounded) variable \\(z\\), we could declare that variable using @variable(model, z). JuMP also requires unique names for each variable, or it will throw an error. This is one place where it’s nice that Julia lets us use sub- and superscripts in variable names!\nIf we did want to modify the bounds after defining the variable, we could do so using the set_lower_bound and set_upper_bound functions, or we could remove them using delete_lower_bound and delete_upper_bound.\nFinally, if we want to see all of the variables associated with a model, we can use the all_variables function to obtain an array.\n\nall_variables(factory_model)\n\n2-element Vector{VariableRef}:\n x\n y\n\n\n\n\n\nDefine Constraints\nWhen defining variables, we were able to declare constraints on their values by specifying upper and lower bounds. However, we also have other constraints, which involve multiple decision variables. These are specified using the @constraint macro. Unlike variables, we also need to pass names for each constraint. We will use time for the time constraint and materials for the materials constraint. These names must be unique.\n\n@constraint(factory_model, time, 6x + 12y &lt;= 80) # specify the time constraint\n@constraint(factory_model, materials, 40x + 20y &lt;= 300) # materials constraint\n\n\n\nDefine Objective Function\nSo far, we’ve defined the feasible region of the decision-variable domain by setting the constraints. But we need to specify our objective function to know what we are trying to minimize or maximize over this region. We define the objective function using the @objective macro. In addition to specifying the model objective and the function, we need to tell JuMP whether we want to minimize or maximize.\n\n@objective(factory_model, Max, 100x + 75y)\n\n\n\nLooking At The Full Model\nNow, let’s look at the model specification. print() will print out a formatted version of the model; in a notebook (or on this page), that will be marked up with LaTeX, in a REPL terminal, it will not be.\n\nprint(factory_model)\n\n\\[ \\begin{aligned}\n\\max\\quad & 100 x + 75 y\\\\\n\\text{Subject to} \\quad & 6 x + 12 y \\leq 80\\\\\n& 40 x + 20 y \\leq 300\\\\\n& x \\geq 0\\\\\n& y \\geq 0\\\\\n\\end{aligned} \\]\n\n\nIf you want a LaTeX-marked up version in the REPL, use latex_formulation().\nWe won’t go into detail here, but there are other ways to define the model, which are detailed in the JuMP documentation. For example, we can specify multiple variables using @variables. Similarly, we can use @constraints to define multiple constraints at once. Or we can use loops to define multiple constraints or constraints involving many variables. We can also specify the model in vectorized syntax, which is similar to how linear programs are specified in MATLAB.\n\n\nSolve the Model\nNow it’s time to solve the model and find the optimal values \\((x^*, y^*)\\). Since we specified the solver when we initialized factory_model, all we have to do is call the optimize! function.\n\noptimize!(factory_model)\n\nRunning HiGHS 1.5.3 [date: 1970-01-01, git hash: 45a127b78]\nCopyright (c) 2023 HiGHS under MIT licence terms\nPresolving model\n2 rows, 2 cols, 4 nonzeros\n2 rows, 2 cols, 4 nonzeros\nPresolve : Reductions: rows 2(-0); columns 2(-0); elements 4(-0) - Not reduced\nProblem not reduced by presolve: solving the LP\nUsing EKK dual simplex solver - serial\n  Iteration        Objective     Infeasibilities num(sum)\n          0    -1.0937489944e+01 Ph1: 2(4.125); Du: 2(10.9375) 0s\n          2     8.4722222222e+02 Pr: 0(0) 0s\nModel   status      : Optimal\nSimplex   iterations: 2\nObjective value     :  8.4722222222e+02\nHiGHS run time      :          0.01\n\n\n\n\nQuery the Solution\nTo find the optimal values of our decision variables, we need to query the values of the variables using value.(). We use value.() (the vectorized version of value()) because JuMP stores decision variables differently depending on their number and how they were defined. Uses the dot-syntax here works with any model specification, while the plain value() will not work if a queried decision variable is stored as a vector.\n\nvalue.(x)\n\n5.555555555555554\n\n\n\nvalue.(y)\n\n3.8888888888888897\n\n\nSo we can see that our optimal inputs are \\[(x^*, y^*) = (5.56, 3.89)\\] (and we’ll pretend that we can manufacture and sell parts of widgets).\n\n\nVisualize the Solution\nLet’s take our previous plot and add the solution point to make sure that we got the solution we expected.\n\ncontour(a,b,(a,b)-&gt;f(a,b),nlevels=15, c=:heat, linewidth=10, colorbar = false, contour_labels = true) # objective function contours\ntitle!(\"Factory Optimization Problem\") # add title\nxaxis!(\"x=Widget A\", lims=(0, maximum(a))) # add x-axis title and limits\nyaxis!(\"y=Widget B\", lims=(0, maximum(b))) # add y-axis title and limits\nxticks!(0:maximum(a)) # set x-axis ticks\nyticks!(0:maximum(b)) # set y-axis ticks\nareaplot!(a, (300 .- 40*a)./20, legend=false, opacity=0.3) # plot materials constraint feasible region\nareaplot!(a, (80 .- 6*a)./12, legend=false, opacity=0.3) # plot time constraint feasible region\n\n## now we plot the solution that we obtained\nscatter!([value.(x)],[value.(y)], markercolor=\"blue\", markersize=5)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n    \n  \n\n\n\n  \n    \n  \n\n\n\n  \n    \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Solution for the widget problem \\(\\eqref{eq:widget}\\). The blue dot shows the optimal solution.\n\n\n\n\nAs shown in Figure 2, the optimal solution \\[(x^*, y^*)\\] is exactly where we deduced it would be geometrically.\n\n\nOther Stuff We Can Do\nWe can also use value.() to evaluate our constraints without manually using the equations.\n\nvalue.(time)\n\n80.0\n\n\n\nvalue.(materials)\n\n300.0\n\n\nWhat if we also want the optimal objective value? We can obtain this using objective_value().\n\nobjective_value(factory_model)\n\n847.2222222222221\n\n\nWe could also define other expressions via the @expression macro as functions of the decision variables and evaluate those. For example, let’s say that we wanted to know the total number of widgets we’d produce under our optimal allocation of resources.\n\n@expression(factory_model, total_widgets, x+y)\nvalue.(total_widgets)\n\n9.444444444444443\n\n\n\n\nDual Solutions\nWe can identify if our model has a dual solution by calling has_duals().\n\nhas_duals(factory_model)\n\ntrue\n\n\nIf we want to know the dual solution associated with a constraint, we use the shadow_price() function.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNaming Constraints\n\n\n\nModifying constraints and querying for dual solutions is the reason why it’s important to give constraints individual names.\n\n\n\nshadow_price(time)\n\n2.777777777777777\n\n\n\nshadow_price(materials)\n\n2.0833333333333335\n\n\nIf the binding constraint was a variable bound, we could also query that shadow price by calling reduced_cost() on the variable.\n\nreduced_cost(x)\n\n-0.0\n\n\n\nreduced_cost(y)\n\n-0.0\n\n\nIn this case, the relevant shadow prices are zero because the optimum is in the interior of the domain. If we had added a strong enough upper bound on the value(s) of one or both of our decision variables (say, \\(x \\leq 4\\)), then this would be non-zero.",

    "title": "Tutorial: Julia Basics",
    "section": "Functions",
    "text": "Functions\nA function is an object which accepts a tuple of arguments and maps them to a return value. In Julia, functions are defined using the following syntax.\n\nfunction my_actual_function(x, y)\n    return x + y\nend\nmy_actual_function(3, 5)\n\n8\n\n\nFunctions in Julia do not require explicit use of a return statement. They will return the last expression evaluated in their definition. However, it’s good style to explicitly return function outputs. This improves readability and debugging, especially when functions can return multiple expressions based on logical control flows (if-then-else blocks).\nFunctions in Julia are objects, and can be treated like other objects. They can be assigned to new variables or passed as arguments to other functions.\n\ng = my_actual_function\ng(3, 5)\n\n8\n\n\n\nfunction function_of_functions(f, x, y)\n    return f(x, y)\nend\nfunction_of_functions(g, 3, 5)\n\n8\n\n\n\nShort and Anonymous Functions\nIn addition to the long form of the function definition shown above, simple functions can be specified in more compact forms when helpful.\nThis is the short form:\n\nh₁(x) = x^2 # make the subscript using \\_1 + &lt;TAB&gt;\nh₁(4)\n\n16\n\n\nThis is the anonymous form:\n\nx-&gt;sin(x)\n(x-&gt;sin(x))(π/4)\n\n0.7071067811865475\n\n\n\n\nMutating Functions\nThe convention in Julia is that functions should not modify (or mutate) their input data. The reason for this is to ensure that the data is preserved. Mutating functions are mainly appropriate for applications where performance needs to be optimized, and making a copy of the input data would be too memory-intensive.\nIf you do write a mutating function in Julia, the convention is to add a ! to its name, like my_mutating_function!(x).\n\n\nOptional arguments\nThere are two extremes with regard to function parameters which do not always need to be changed. The first is to hard-code them into the function body, which has a clear downside: when you do want to change them, the function needs to be edited directly. The other extreme is to treat them as regular arguments, passing them every time the function is called. This has the downside of potentially creating bloated function calls, particularly when there is a standard default value that makes sense for most function evaluations.\nMost modern languages, including Julia, allow an alternate solution, which is to make these arguments optional. This involves setting a default value, which is used unless the argument is explicitly defined in a function call.\n\nfunction setting_optional_arguments(x, y, c=0.5)\n    return c * (x + y)\nend\n\nsetting_optional_arguments (generic function with 2 methods)\n\n\nIf we want to stick with the fixed value \\(c=0.5\\), all we have to do is call setting_optional_arguments with the x and y arguments.\n\nsetting_optional_arguments(3, 5)\n\n4.0\n\n\nOtherwise, we can pass a new value for c.\n\nsetting_optional_arguments(3, 5, 2)\n\n16\n\n\n\n\nPassing data structures as arguments\nInstead of passing variables individually, it may make sense to pass a data structure, such as an array or a tuple, and then unpacking within the function definition. This is straightforward in long form: access the appropriate elements using their index.\nIn short or anonymous form, there is a trick which allows the use of readable variables within the function definition.\n\nh₂((x,y)) = x*y # enclose the input arguments in parentheses to tell Julia to expect and unpack a tuple\n\nh₂ (generic function with 1 method)\n\n\n\nh₂((2, 3)) # this works perfectly, as we passed in a tuple\n\n6\n\n\n\nh₂(2, 3) # this gives an error, as h₂ expects a single tuple, not two different numeric values\n\nLoadError: MethodError: no method matching h₂(::Int64, ::Int64)\n\n\u001b[0mClosest candidates are:\n\u001b[0m  h₂(::Any)\n\u001b[0m\u001b[90m   @\u001b[39m \u001b[32mMain\u001b[39m \u001b[90m\u001b[4mIn[50]:1\u001b[24m\u001b[39m\n\n\n\nh₂([3, 10]) # this also works with arrays instead of tuples\n\n30\n\n\n\n\nVectorized operations\nJulia uses dot syntax to vectorize an operation and apply it element-wise across an array.\nFor example, to calculate the square root of 3:\n\nsqrt(3)\n\n1.7320508075688772\n\n\nTo calculate the square roots of every integer between 1 and 5:\n\nsqrt.([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])\n\n5-element Vector{Float64}:\n 1.0\n 1.4142135623730951\n 1.7320508075688772\n 2.0\n 2.23606797749979\n\n\nThe same dot syntax is used for arithmetic operations over arrays, since these operations are really functions.\n\n[1, 2, 3, 4] .* 2\n\n4-element Vector{Int64}:\n 2\n 4\n 6\n 8\n\n\nVectorization can be faster and is more concise to write and read than applying the same function to multiple variables or objects explicitly, so take advantage!\n\n\nReturning multiple values\nYou can return multiple values by separating them with a comma. This implicitly causes the function to return a tuple of values.\n\nfunction return_multiple_values(x, y)\n    return x + y, x * y\nend\nreturn_multiple_values(3, 5)\n\n(8, 15)\n\n\nThese values can be unpacked into multiple variables.\n\nn, ν = return_multiple_values(3, 5)\nn\n\n8\n\n\n\nν\n\n15\n\n\n\n\nReturning nothing\nSometimes you don’t want a function to return any values at all. For example, you might want a function that only prints a string to the console.\n\nfunction print_some_string(x)\n    println(\"x: $x\")\n    return nothing\nend\nprint_some_string(42)\n\nx: 42",

    "section": "Control Flows",
    "text": "Control Flows\nOne of the tricky things about learning a new programming language can be getting used to the specifics of control flow syntax. These types of flows include conditional if-then-else statements or loops.\n\nConditional Blocks\nConditional blocks allow different pieces of code to be evaluated depending on the value of a boolean expression or variable. For example, if we wanted to compute the absolute value of a number, rather than using abs():\n\nfunction our_abs(x)\n    if x &gt;= 0\n        return x\n    else\n        return -x\n    end\nend\n\nour_abs (generic function with 1 method)\n\n\n\nour_abs(4)\n\n4\n\n\n\nour_abs(-4)\n\n4\n\n\nTo nest conditional statements, use elseif.\n\nfunction test_sign(x)\n    if x &gt; 0\n        return Text(\"x is positive.\")\n    elseif x &lt; 0\n        return Text(\"x is negative.\")\n    else\n        return Text(\"x is zero.\")\n    end\nend\n\ntest_sign (generic function with 1 method)\n\n\n\ntest_sign(-5)\n\nx is negative.\n\n\n\ntest_sign(0)\n\nx is zero.\n\n\n\n\nLoops\nLoops allow expressions to be evaluated repeatedly until they are terminated. The two main types of loops are while loops and for loops.\n\nWhile loops\nwhile loops continue to evaluate an expression so long as a specified boolean condition is true. This is useful when you don’t know how many iterations it will take for the desired goal to be reached.\n\nfunction compute_factorial(x)\n    factorial = 1\n    while (x &gt; 1)\n        factorial *= x\n        x -= 1\n    end\n    return factorial\nend\ncompute_factorial(5)\n\n120\n\n\n\nWhile loops can easily turn into infinite loops if the condition is never meaningfully updated. Be careful, and look there if your programs are getting stuck. Also, If the expression in a while loop is false when the loop is reached, the loop will never be evaluated.\n\n\n\nFor loops\nfor loops run for a finite number of iterations, based on some defined index variable.\n\nfunction add_some_numbers(x)\n    total_sum = 0 # initialize at zero since we're adding\n    for i=1:x # the counter i is updated every iteration\n        total_sum += i\n    end\n    return total_sum\nend\nadd_some_numbers(4)\n\n10\n\n\nfor loops can also iterate over explicitly passed containers, rather than iterating over an incrementally-updated index sequence. Use the in keyword when defining the loop.\n\nfunction add_passed_numbers(set)\n    total_sum = 0\n    for i in set # this is the syntax we use when we want i to correspond to different container values\n        total_sum += i\n    end\n    return total_sum\nend\nadd_passed_numbers([1, 3, 5])\n\n9",

We can visualize the supply curve (or the dispatch stack) to see the order in which electricity is dispatched.\n\n\nCode\nsupply_curve = DataFrame( \n    name = gen_names, \n    pmin = gen_minpower, \n    cap = gen_maxpower .- gen_minpower,\n    varcost = gen_varcost \n)\n\nsort!(supply_curve, [:varcost, order(:cap, rev=true)])\n\n\n5×4 DataFrame\n\n\n\nRow\nname\npmin\ncap\nvarcost\n\n\n\nString\nInt64\nInt64\nFloat64\n\n\n\n\n1\nWind\n0\n200\n0.0\n\n\n2\nHydro\n0\n150\n0.0\n\n\n3\nNuclear\n200\n800\n2.0\n\n\n4\nCoal\n160\n540\n21.5\n\n\n5\nNatural Gas\n40\n460\n23.0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\nrectangle(w, h, x, y) = Shape(x .+ [0,w,w,0], y .+ [0,0,h,h]) \n\np = plot(grid=:false, color_palette=:tol_muted, legend=:left, legendfontsize=20, tickfontsize=20, guidefontsize=20) \nmarg_gen = 0 \nmarg_price = 0 \nx = 0 \n\nplot!(p, rectangle(sum(supply_curve.pmin), 0.5, x, 0), opacity=.5, label = \"minimum\", color=\"black\") \nx = x + sum(supply_curve.pmin) \nfor i in 1:nrow(supply_curve) \n    if supply_curve[i, :varcost] == 0 \n        plot!(p, rectangle(supply_curve[i, :cap], 0.5,x,0), opacity=.5, label = supply_curve[i, :name]) \n    else \n        plot!(p, rectangle(supply_curve[i, :cap], supply_curve[i, :varcost],x,0), opacity=.5, label = supply_curve[i, :name]) \n    end \n    if (x &lt; demand) && (x + supply_curve[i,:cap] &gt; demand) \n        marg_gen = i \n        marg_price = supply_curve[i,:varcost] \n    end \n    x = x + supply_curve[i,:cap] \nend \nvline!([demand],linecolor=\"black\",linewidth=5, linestyle=:dash, label = \"demand\") \nhline!([marg_price],linecolor=\"blue\", linestyle=:dot, linewidth=5, label = \"Electricity Price\") \nxlabel!(\"Capacity (MW)\") \nylabel!(\"Marginal Cost (\\$/MW)\") \nplot!(size=(800, 600))\nplot!(right_margin=13mm, left_margin=5mm, bottom_margin=5mm)"

though hydro is effectively zero-cost, we reduce dispatched hydropower in hour 4 because coal is at its minimum generating capacity and nuclear can’t be ramped down further. These constraints complicate the simple merit order that we previously saw.\nThese constraints also play a major role in systems with high levels of renewable penetration. For example, the so-called California “duck curve” is created by the challenges of ramping generation between the early afternoon, when solar generation is at its maximum, and in the evening, when solar generation is decreasing and demand increases rapidly.\n\n\n\nCalifornia Duck Curve"

    "text": "Problems (Total: 40 Points)\n\nA river which flows at 6 km/d is receiving waste discharges from two sources which are 15 km apart, as shown in Figure 1. The oxygen reaeration rate is 0.55 day-1, and the decay rates of CBOD and NBOD are are 0.35 and 0.25 day-1, respectively. The river’s saturated dissolved oxygen concentration is 10m g/L. The inflow values are measured at the point where the first waste discharge enters the river.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Schematic of the system\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell .markdown}\n\nProblem 1 (8 points)\nIf the characteristics of the river inflow and waste discharges are given in Table 1, write a Julia model to compute the dissolved oxygen concentration from the first wastewater discharge to an arbitrary distance d km downstream. Use your model to compute the minimum dissolved oxygen concentration up to 50km downstream and how far downriver this minimum occurs.\n\n\n\nTable 1: River inflow and waste stream characteristics for Problem 1.\n\n\n\n\n\nParameter\nRiver Inflow\nWaste Stream 1\nWaste Stream 2\n\n\n\n\nInflow\n100 m3/d\n10 m3/d\n15 m3/d\n\n\nDO Concentration\n7.5 mg/L\n5 mg/L\n5 mg/L\n\n\nCBOD\n5 mg/L\n50 mg/L\n45 mg/L\n\n\nNBOD\n5 mg/L\n35 mg/L\n35 mg/L\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution:\nWe can think of each segment of the river between discharges as a box model, and the overall river as a combination of two boxes:\n\nBox 1 goes from discharge 1 to discharge 2;\nBox 2 goes from discharge 2 downstream.\n\nAs a result, we can structure our code in two functions, one to compute the dissolved oxygen for each box (do_box()), and the main function to loop over the boxes (do_simulate()). Note that do_box() should return the CBOD and NBOD as well as the DO, because we will need this output to compute the initial conditions of the next box.\nWe will also write a helper function mixed_concentration() to compute mixtures of the inflows and the discharges, as we will reuse that calculation multiple times for each box.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDesign Choices\n\n\n\nHowever, this is not essential, and there are other solutions which would work. For example, you could just write a single function and use if-else statements to capture the different boundary conditions, but the disadvantage of this approach is that it’s a bit messier, might be harder to debug, and would require more work to adapt to changes in the problem.\n\n\n\n## mixed_concentration calculates the concentration after a mixing of flow 0 and flow 1; C is the concentration and V is the volume\nfunction mixed_concentration(C0, C1, V0, V1)\n  return (V0 * C0 + V1 * C1) / (V0 + V1)\nend\n\n## do_box will accept three parameters: the initial conditions (the results of mixing the discharge and the inflow), the river DO dynamics properties, and the length of the box (d). The first two of these will be tuples, so we can unpack and refer to names, which will make the code more readable, but using other data structures would be fine.\nfunction do_box(init_cond, river, d)\n    C₀, B₀, N₀ = init_cond # unpack initial conditions\n    ka, kc, kn, Cs, U = river # unpack river properties\n\n    # broadcast the DO computation over the box; this avoids a loop (but looping is also fine, you'll just need to pre-allocate storage and maybe set the initial conditions to be the first value)\n    x = 0:d # creates a step from the initial values to length d\n    B = B₀ .* exp.(-kc .* x ./ U)\n    N = N₀ .* exp.(-kn .* x ./ U)\n    α1 = exp.(-ka .* x ./ U)\n    α2 = (kc/(ka-kc)) .* (exp.(-kc .* x / U) .- α1)\n    α3 = (kn/(ka-kn)) .* (exp.(-kn .* x / U) .- α1)\n    C = Cs .* (1 .- α1) + (C₀ .* α1) - (B₀ .* α2) - (N₀ .* α3)\n\n    return (C, B, N)\nend\n\n# For do_simulate(), we will write the function to accept tuples with the inflow, discharges (this will be an array of tuples, one for each box), and river characteristics, and an array of box lengths\nfunction do_simulate(inflow, discharges, river, box_lengths)\n    # initialize storage\n    C = zeros(sum(box_lengths) + 1)\n    B = zeros(sum(box_lengths) + 1)\n    N = zeros(sum(box_lengths) + 1)\n    V = inflow[4] # initialize volume\n    init_idx = 1 # initialize initial index\n    # loop over the boxes and do the computations\n    for i = 1:length(box_lengths)\n        # if this is the first box, the initial mixture uses the inflow, otherwise, the last value of the prior computation; we'll also compute the initial index for storing this box's simulation\n        if i == 1\n            Cin, Bin, Nin = inflow # this ignores Vin at position 4\n        else\n            Cin = C[box_lengths[i-1] + 1]\n            Bin = B[box_lengths[i-1] + 1]\n            Nin = B[box_lengths[i-1] + 1]\n            init_idx += box_lengths[i-1]  # note that this will overwrite the values we just pulled, as this is the \"true\" value at the point of mixing\n        end\n        Cd, Bd, Nd, Vd = discharges[i] # unpack discharge concentrations and volume\n        # compute initial conditions for this box by mixing\n        C₀ = mixed_concentration(Cin, Cd, V, Vd)\n        B₀ = mixed_concentration(Bin, Bd, V, Vd)\n        N₀ = mixed_concentration(Nin, Nd, V, Vd)\n        V += Vd # update volume\n        init_cond = (C₀, B₀, N₀)\n        # simulate the next box and store the values\n        sim_out = do_box(init_cond, river, box_lengths[i])\n        C[init_idx:(init_idx + box_lengths[i])] = sim_out[1] \n        B[init_idx:(init_idx + box_lengths[i])] = sim_out[2] \n        N[init_idx:(init_idx + box_lengths[i])] = sim_out[3] \n    end\n    return (C, B, N)\nend\n\ndo_simulate (generic function with 1 method)\n\n\n\nriver = (0.55, 0.35, 0.25, 10, 6)\ninflow = (7.5, 5, 5, 100000) # after converting volume to L\ndischarges = [(5, 50, 35, 10000), (5, 45, 35, 15000)]\nbox_lengths = [15, 35]\n\nC, B, N = do_simulate(inflow, discharges, river, box_lengths)\n\nmin_C = findmin(C)\n\n(3.8135299699779512, 23)\n\n\nThe minimum value is approximately 3.8 mg/L, and occurs 22 km downstream of the initial discharge (since position 1 is \\(x=0\\)).\n\n\nProblem 2 (4 points)\nPlot the dissolved oxygen concentration in the river from the first waste stream to 50km downstream, along with the CBOD and NBOD (on the same axes). What do you observe?\n\nSolution:\n\nplot(0:50, C, color=:black, linewidth=2, label=\"DO\", grid=:false)\nplot!(0:50, B, color=:blue, linestyle=:dash, label=\"CBOD\")\nplot!(0:50, N, color=:red, linestyle=:dash, label=\"NBOD\")\nxlabel!(\"Downstream Distance (km)\")\nylabel!(\"Concentration (mg/L)\")\n\n\n\n\n  \n    \n  \n\n\n\n  \n    \n  \n\n\n\n  \n    \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe can see the spike in the NBOD and CBOD immediately after the discharge and the corresponding drop in the DO. As the CBOD and NBOD decrease, the DO can recover from reaeration.\n\nProblem 3 (3 points)\nUnder the assumptions of Problem 1, determine the distance from waste stream 2 it will take for the dissolved oxygen concentration of the river to recover to 6 mg/L.\n\nSolution:\n\nlow_do = findall(C .&gt;= 6)\n\n13-element Vector{Int64}:\n  1\n  2\n  3\n 42\n 43\n 44\n 45\n 46\n 47\n 48\n 49\n 50\n 51\n\n\nThe DO concentration recovers to 6 mg/L 41 km downstream (since \\(x=0\\) is index 1) from the initial discharge, or 26 km downstream from the second waste stream.\n\nProblem 4 (5 points)\nWhat is the minimum level of treatment (% removal of organic waste from the stream) for waste stream 2 that will ensure that the dissolved oxygen concentration never drops below 4 mg/L, assuming that waste stream 1 remains untreated?\n\nSolution:\nDue to how we structured the solution in Problem 1, we can modify the discharge 2 CBOD and NBOD values and leave everything else alone. We will do this using a function which takes in a treatment efficiency and the problem properties, runs the DO simulation with that level of treatment, and returns the minimum value. One advantage of this approach is the original discharges data remains the same, so we can reuse it in subsequent simulations. We can then broadcast that function over an efficiency range, and find the first minimum that is greater than 4 mg/L.\n\neff = 0:0.01:1 # range of treatment efficiencies to consider \n\nfunction waste2_treatment(eff, inflow, discharges, river, box_lengths)\n    treated_discharge2 = (5, (1-eff) * 45, (1-eff) * 35, 15000)\n    C, B, N = do_simulate(inflow, [discharges[1], treated_discharge2], river, box_lengths)\n    return minimum(C)\nend\n\n# use a comprehension to loop over the efficiency values; we could do this with a regular loop as well\nmin_do = [waste2_treatment(e, inflow, discharges, river, box_lengths) for e in eff]\neff[findfirst(min_do .&gt;= 4)] # get the efficiency value by finding the index of the first minimum value which complies\n\n0.09\n\n\nSo the lowest treatment level that will meet the requirement is 9%.\n\nProblem 5 (5 points)\nIf both waste streams are treated equally, what is the minimum level of treatment (% removal of organic waste) for the two sources required to ensure that the dissolved oxygen concentration never drops below 4 mg/L?\n\nSolution:\n\nfunction waste_both_treatment(eff, inflow, discharges, river, box_lengths)\n    treated_discharges = [(5, (1-eff) * 50, (1-eff) * 35, 10000), (5, (1-eff) * 45, (1-eff) * 35, 15000)]\n    C, B, N = do_simulate(inflow, treated_discharges, river, box_lengths)\n    return minimum(C)\nend\n\n# use a comprehension to loop over the efficiency values; we could do this with a regular loop as well\nmin_do = [waste_both_treatment(e, inflow, discharges, river, box_lengths) for e in eff]\neff[findfirst(min_do .&gt;= 4)] # get the efficiency value by finding the index of the first minimum value which complies\n\n0.05\n\n\nBoth sources would have to be treated at 5%.\n\nProblem 6 (5 points)\nSuppose you are responsible for designing a waste treatment plan for discharges into the river, with a regulatory mandate to keep the dissolved oxygen concentration above 4 mg/L. Discuss whether you’d opt to treat waste stream 2 alone or both waste streams equally. What other information might you need to make a conclusion, if any?\n\nSolution:\nEither choice is defensible depending on the reasoning. Some relevant information might include costs (which is unknown) for each source to treat its waste, or the larger volume of wastewater produced by source 2.\n\nProblem 7 (5 points)\nSuppose that it is known that the DO concentrations at the river inflow can vary uniformly between 6 mg/L and 8 mg/L. How often will the treatment plan identified in Problem 5 (both waste streams treated equally) fail to comply with the regulatory standard?\n\nSolution:\nThere are a few ways to solve this, but in this case, we’ll just loop over values between 6 and 8 mg/L since the values vary uniformly.\n\ninflow_do = 6:0.01:8\nmin_do = [waste_both_treatment(0.05, (k, 5, 5, 100000), discharges, river, box_lengths) for k in inflow_do]\nsum(min_do .&lt; 4) / length(min_do) # get the fraction of values which fall short\n\n0.746268656716418\n\n\nThe plan will fail 75% of the time.\n\nProblem 8 (5 points)\nA factory is planning a third wastewater discharge into the river downstream of the second plant. This discharge would consist of 5 m3/day of wastewater with a dissolved oxygen content of 4.5 mg/L and CBOD and NBOD levels of 50 and 45 mg/L, respectively.\nAssume that the treatment plan you identified in Problem 5 is still in place for the existing discharges. If the third discharge will not be treated, under the original inflow conditions (7.5 mg/L DO), how far downstream from the second discharge does this third discharge need to be placed to keep the river concentration from dropping below 4 mg/L?\n\nSolution:\n\nfunction add_third_discharge(pos, inflow, all_discharges, river, box_lengths)\n    positions = [box_lengths[1], box_lengths[1] + pos, 50 - box_lengths[1] - pos] # find new box lengths\n    C, B, N = do_simulate(inflow, all_discharges, river, positions)\n    return C\nend\n\nall_discharges = [(5, (1-0.09) * 50, (1-0.09) * 35, 10000), (5, (1-0.09) * 45, (1-0.09) * 35, 15000), (4.5, 50, 45, 5000)]\n\npos = 1:20\n\nthird_do_min = [minimum(add_third_discharge(p, inflow, all_discharges, river, box_lengths)) for p in pos]\nfindfirst(third_do_min .&gt;= 4)\n\n9\n\n\nSo the third discharge needs to be placed at least 9 km downstream of the second discharge."

    "text": "Problem 2 (5 points)\nThe Showcase is the final round of every episode of The Price is Right, matching the two big winners from the episode. Each contestant is shown a “showcase” of prizes, which are usually some combination of a trip, a motor vehicle, some furniture, and maybe some other stuff. They then each have to make a bid on the retail price of the showcase. The rules are:\n\nan overbid is an automatic loss;\nthe contest who gets closest to the retail price wins their showcase;\nif a contestant gets within $250 of the retail price and is closer than their opponent, they win both showcases.\n\nYour goal is to find a wager which maximizes your expected winnings, which we may as well call utility, based on your assessment of the probability of your showcase retail price.\nWe’ll assume that the distribution of all showcases offered by the show is given as truncated normal distribution, which means a normal distribution which has an upper and/or lower bound. Distributions.jl makes it easy to specify truncations on any distribution, not just normal distributions. For example, we’ll use this distribution for the showcase values:\n\nshowcase_dist = truncated(Normal(31000, 4500), lower=5000, upper=42000)\n\nTruncated(Normal{Float64}(μ=31000.0, σ=4500.0); lower=5000.0, upper=42000.0)\n\n\n\nProblem 2.1 (3 points)\nWrite a function showcase() which takes in a bid value and uses Monte Carlo simulation to compute the expected value of the winnings. Make the following assumptions about your expected winnings if you don’t overbid:\n\nIf you win both showcases, the value is the double of the single showcase value.\nIf you did not win both showcases but bid under the showcase value, the probability of being outbid increases linearly as the distance between your bid and the value increases (in other words, if you bid the exact value, you win with probability 1, and if you bid $0, you win with probability 0).\n\nHow did you decide how many samples to use within the function?\n\n# the syntax (...; param=val) is used for optional\n# arguments, which are given a default. these arguments must be\n# named in subsequent calls if they are changed, as we will see below.\nfunction showcase(bid; nsamples = 500000)\n    samples = rand(showcase_dist, nsamples)\n    winnings = 0 # running total of winnings over the simulations\n    for (i, value) in pairs(samples)\n        if 0 &lt; (value - bid) &lt; 250\n            winnings += 2 * value\n        elseif bid &lt; value\n            p_win = bid / value\n            winnings += value * p_win\n        end\n    end\n    # return expected winnings\n    return winnings / nsamples\nend\n\nshowcase (generic function with 1 method)\n\n\nOne could justify the number of samples by looking at the plot of the Monte Carlo estimate as additional samples are created (for example, analogously to Problem 1.2). However, this should not be done arbitrarily.\n\n\nProblem 2.2 (2 points)\nPlot the expected winnings for bids ranging from $0 to $42,000. What do you notice?\nSolution:\n\nbids = 0:500:42000\nexpected_winnings = showcase.(bids)\nplot(bids, expected_winnings, xlabel=\"Showcase Bid (\\$)\", ylabel=\"Expected Winnings (\\$)\", label=:false)\n\n\n\n\n  \n    \n  \n\n\n\n  \n    \n  \n\n\n\n  \n    \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe bid is maximized around $25,000, which we can see with the following code:\n\n# get index 2 from findmax, which returns both the value and the index of the maximum\nbest_idx = findmax(expected_winnings)[2]\nbids[best_idx]\n\n25000\n\n\nFinding this value explicitly was not required, but at least some analysis of the plot would be useful! More than that starts to increase the risk of an overbid, while less than that and we open up space for our opponent to outbid us. Due to the asymmetry of the problem, the dropoff from the “best” bid is quite rapid; this is similar to when we have a strong constraint on an environmental system (such as a regulatory limit) and there can be a large penalty for exceeding it.\nAlso, this is a point where if we had used too few samples in Problem 2.2, we might have noticed that our plot would be less smooth than expected due to the lack of convergence. This could distort our analysis of the resulting plot/simulations."

    "text": "Problems (Total: 40 Points)\n\nProblem 1 (12 points)\nRecall from class that the simple energy balance model (EBM) of planetary energy balance links changes in radiative forcing (\\(F\\)) to global mean temperature (\\(T\\)) changes through the discretized equation \\[T_{i+1} = T_{i} + \\frac{F_i - \\lambda T_i}{cd} \\times \\Delta t,\\] where \\(i\\) is the current time step, \\(c = 4.184 \\times 10^6\\) J/K/m2 is the heat capacity of water per unit area, \\(d\\) is the (uncertain) depth of the mixing layer, \\(\\Delta t\\) is the annual time step in seconds and \\(\\lambda = F_{\\text{2xCO}_2}/S\\) is the climate feedback parameter in W/m2/\\(^\\circ\\) C, where \\(S\\) is the equilibrium climate sensitivity (the uncertain equilibrium temperature change resulting from a doubling of atmospheric CO2). Finally, while total radiative forcing can be the result of non-aerosol and aerosol effects, we do not know the relative intensity of aerosol forcing, so we represent this with an uncertain aerosol scaling factor \\(\\alpha\\).\nWe can implement this model with the following Julia function. We will assume an ocean mixing depth \\(d = 100\\) m and an aerosol scaling factor \\(\\alpha = 1.3\\) so we can focus on the uncertainty in \\(S\\).\nThe last technical concern is that “global mean temperature” does not make sense in absolute terms as a marker of climate change. Instead, we typically refer to temperature changes relative to some historical pre-industrial baseline. In this case, we will use the period from 1880-1900, though this choice can vary.\n\n\n# we need to split up the aerosol and non-aerosol forcings when we call the function\nfunction energy_balance_model(S, forcing_aerosol, forcing_non_aerosol)\n    d = 100 # ocean mixing depth [m]\n    α = 1.3 # aerosol scaling factor\n    F2xCO₂ = 4.0 # radiative forcing [W/m²] for a doubling of CO₂\n    λ = F2xCO₂/S\n    \n    c = 4.184e6 # heat capacity/area [J/K/m²]\n    C = c*d # heat capacity of mixed layer (per area)\n\n    F = forcing_non_aerosol + α*forcing_aerosol # radiative forcing\n\n    Δt = 31558152.0 # annual timestep [s]\n    \n    T = zero(F)\n    for i in 1:length(F)-1\n        T[i+1] = T[i] + (F[i] - λ*T[i])/C * Δt\n    end\n    # return temperature anomaly relative to 1880-1900 baseline\n    return T .- mean(T[1:21]) \nend\n\nenergy_balance_model (generic function with 1 method)\n\n\nFinally, we need to load some radiative forcing data. We will use the radiative forcing scenario RCP 8.5. We can load this data, which is in a .csv (comma-delimited) file, into a DataFrame, which is a tabular data structure. Rows and columns in a DataFrame can be accessed using their numerical index (like a matrix), but columns also have names; you can access a particular column in a dataframe df by name using df.colname or df[:, \"colname\"].\nOf note: this data set goes from 1750–2500, so you will need to take care to make sure you are using the right years at each step. For example, here we will constrain the data to 1880–2100, which is the period we are interested in.\n\n# The CSV is read into a DataFrame object, and we specify that it is comma delimited\nforcings_all_85 = CSV.read(\"data/ERF_ssp585_1750-2500.csv\", DataFrame, delim=\",\")\n\n# get the years corresponding to the forcings\nt = Int64.(forcings_all_85[!,\"year\"]) # Ensure that years are interpreted as integers\n# find the indices of the years 1880 and 2100\n# we can do this with the indexin function\ntime_bounds = indexin([1880, 2100], t)\nyears = time_bounds[1]:time_bounds[2] # create range of years\n\n# Separate out the individual components\nforcing_co2_85 = forcings_all_85[years,\"co2\"]\n# Get total aerosol and non-aerosol forcings\nforcing_aerosol_rad_85 = forcings_all_85[years,\"aerosol-radiation_interactions\"]\nforcing_aerosol_cloud_85 = forcings_all_85[years,\"aerosol-cloud_interactions\"]\nforcing_aerosol_85 = forcing_aerosol_rad_85 + forcing_aerosol_cloud_85 # aerosol forcings\nforcing_total_85 = forcings_all_85[years,\"total\"] \nforcing_non_aerosol_85 = forcing_total_85 - forcing_aerosol_85 # non-aerosol forcings\n\n221-element Vector{Float64}:\n  0.42741479112315905\n  0.4487940147601447\n  0.4900144276528058\n -0.019811270078689047\n -1.480725700367619\n -0.3154905163510021\n  0.233186559774844\n  0.2923308952663089\n  0.45833872365810924\n  0.5168189581089915\n  0.4144761329626494\n  0.2762327724171124\n  0.48656957869238376\n  ⋮\n  9.560222650653953\n  9.671039126229665\n  9.772610821460296\n  9.879065698371564\n  9.946850640754889\n 10.002169546141578\n 10.061009359425011\n 10.115684195707905\n 10.182946497594184\n 10.249699157847772\n 10.331407709334023\n 10.424544495740134\n\n\nFor this assignment, you can use the forcing_aerosol_85 and forcing_non_aerosol_85 vectors as is to correspond to the relevant forcings. You will need to use the vector t to find the appropriate years for analysis.\n\nProblem 1.1 (3 points)\nAssume that \\(S\\) is distributed according to \\(\\text{LogNormal}(\\log(3.2), \\log{2}/3)\\) (as in class). Draw 10,000 samples from this distribution and make a histogram.\n\n\nProblem 1.2 (5 points)\nUse the EBM to propagate your samples of \\(S\\) to a distribution of global mean temperature. Plot the median and 90% predictive distribution (between the .05 and .95 quantiles) from 1880-2100.\n\n\nProblem 1.3 (4 points)\nMake a histogram of global mean temperature projections in 2100. If you compare this distribution to the distribution of \\(S\\) from Problem 1.1, what do you observe?\n\n\nProblem 2 (15 points)\nChanges to global temperatures cause changes in global sea levels through several mechanisms, including thermal expansion (the change in ocean volume due to increased heat content) and melting land-based ice. One simple way to represent this link is through the following model, proposed by Rahmstorf (2007).\n\\[\\frac{dH}{dt} = a(T-T_0),\\]\nwhere \\(H\\) is the global mean sea level in mm, \\(T\\) is global mean temperature, \\(T_0\\) is an equilibrium temperature (where there is no change in sea levels), and \\(a\\) is a proportionality constant. This model can be discretized to give \\[H_{i+1} - H_i = a (T_i - T_0).\\]\nNote that, like with global mean temperature, the notion of “global mean sea level” does not make sense in absolute terms (were sea levels ever at “zero”?). Instead, we want to normalize this relative to some historical baseline. In this case (with a view towards Problem 3), we will compute our sea levels relative to the 2010 sea level. Note that in addition to the model parameters, we also need an initial sea-level parameter \\(H_0\\) which will give us the right anomaly level.\nThe best estimates for these parameters are:\n\n\\(a = 1.86\\);\n\\(H_0 = -223\\);\n\\(T_0 = -0.62\\)\n\n\n\nProblem 2.1 (5 points)\nWrite a function sea_level_model() to implement the mathematical sea-level rise model described above. It should take in needed parameters and a vector of temperatures and return a vector of sea levels. To test your function, use the provided temperature series historical_temps (read in below) to compute the global mean sea level anomaly in 2022 (the last year of the dataset) with the parameter values above; you should get a value of approximately 40mm.\n\n\nhistorical_temp_data = CSV.read(\"data/HadCRUT.5.0.1.0.analysis.summary_series.global.annual.csv\", DataFrame, delim=\",\")\n# column 2 is the temperature anomaly, column 1 is the year\ntemp_bds = indexin([1880, 1900], historical_temp_data[!, 1]) # find the index of 2010 for normalization\nhistorical_temp_data[:, 2] .-= mean(historical_temp_data[temp_bds[1]:temp_bds[2], 2])\nhistorical_temps = historical_temp_data[temp_bds[1]:end, 2]\n\n143-element Vector{Float64}:\n  0.07297116761904765\n  0.15655772761904765\n  0.09327316761904769\n  0.04232884761904765\n -0.10351681238095234\n -0.08232033238095232\n -0.03210037238095231\n -0.10998251238095236\n  0.00942435761904764\n  0.13890768761904768\n -0.11805492238095233\n -0.012511692380952344\n -0.11875525238095236\n  ⋮\n  0.9265009776190476\n  0.9664103476190478\n  1.0123786476190477\n  1.0616748976190478\n  1.2139176176190476\n  1.3217303776190477\n  1.2339774976190476\n  1.1514572476190477\n  1.2798758476190477\n  1.3115970476190477\n  1.1506591476190478\n  1.1896871476190476\n\n\n\nProblem 2.2 (5 points)\nEvaluate sea_level_model() using the projected temperature ensemble from Problem 1.

What can you observe about how the ECS uncertainty has impacted sea-level uncertainty under this radiative forcing scenario? What might the implications be of only using the best-estimate ECS value?\n\n\nProblem 3 (13 points)\nYou’ve been asked to consult on a levee reliability analysis. For context, levees in the United States are supposed to only fail once in 100 years, or, in other words, to have at most a 1% chance of failure in a given year. We will assume for this problem that the only way in which a levee fails is by being overtopped (note: this is unrealistic).\nWe can assess the probability of levee overtopping by comparing its height to a distribution of extreme sea levels. A common approach is to look at the distribution of the highest sea level each year. These extreme sea levels can be obtained by combining the absolute sea level (we will use our distribution of global sea levels for this), the rate of subsidence (how much the ground sinks), and the distribution of storm tides (the highest tide level, which is often the result of storm surges combining with high tide).\nAssume for this problem that:\n\nthe annual rate of subsidence \\(\\nu\\) is 1.2mm/yr;\nthe distribution of annual storm tide maxima, above the mean sea level, is (and is expected to continue to be) given by a \\(\\text{GeneralizedExtremeValue}(900, 25, 0.3)\\) distribution, which looks like this:\n\n\n\ntide_distribution = GeneralizedExtremeValue(900, 25, 0.3)\n    histogram(rand(tide_distribution, 10000), xlabel=\"Storm Tide Height (mm)\", ylabel=\"Count\", legend=:false)\n\n\n\n\n  \n    \n  \n\n\n\n  \n    \n  \n\n\n\n  \n    \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFeel free to just sample from tide_distribution in your solution below.\n\nProblem 3.1 (2 points)\nHow would you use your sea-level simulations and the above information to compute a distribution of extreme sea levels in 2100 relative to 2010 mean sea level?

The original coder was not very considerate of other potential users: the function is called mystery_function and there are no comments explaining the purpose of the code. It appears to take in an array and return some numbers, and you’ve been assured that the code works as intended.\n\n\nfunction mystery_function(values)\n    y = []\n    for v in values\n        if !(v in y)\n            append!(y, v)\n        end\n    end\n    return y\nend\n\nlist_of_values = [1, 2, 3, 4, 3, 4, 2, 1]\n@show mystery_function(list_of_values);\n\nmystery_function(list_of_values) = Any[1, 2, 3, 4]\n\n\n\nProblem 3.1 (4 points)\nExplain the purpose of mystery_function.\n\n\nProblem 3.2 (4 points)\nAdd comments to the code, explaining why and how it works. Refer to “Best Practices for Writing Code Comments”, and remember that bad comments can be just as bad as no comments at all. You do not need to add comments to every line (in fact, this is very bad practice), but you should note the purpose of every “section” of code, and add comments explaining any code sequences that you don’t immediately understand.\n\n\nProblem 4 (16 points)\nCheap Plastic Products, Inc. is operating a plant that produces \\(100 \\text{m}^3\\text{/day}\\) of wastewater that is discharged into Pristine Brook. The wastewater contains \\(1 \\text{kg/m}^3\\) of YUK, a toxic substance. The US Environmental Protection Agency has imposed an effluent standard on the plant prohibiting discharge of more than \\(20 \\text{kg/day}\\) of YUK into Pristine Brook.\nCheap Plastic Products has analyzed two methods for reducing its discharges of YUK. Method 1 is land disposal, which costs \\(X_1^2/20\\) dollars per day, where \\(X_1\\) is the amount of wastewater disposed of on the land (\\(\\text{m}^3\\text{/day}\\)). With this method, 20% of the YUK applied to the land will eventually drain into the stream (i.e., 80% of the YUK is removed by the soil).\nMethod 2 is a chemical treatment procedure which costs $1.50 per \\(\\text{m}^3\\) of wastewater treated. The chemical treatment has an efficiency of \\(e= 1 - 0.005X_2\\), where \\(X_2\\) is the quantity of wastewater (\\(\\text{m}^3\\text{/day}\\)) treated. For example, if \\(X_2 = 50 \\text{m}^3\\text{/day}\\), then \\(e = 1 - 0.005(50) = 0.75\\), so that 75% of the YUK is removed.\nCheap Plastic Products is wondering how to allocate their wastewater between these three disposal and treatment methods (land disposal, and chemical treatment, and land disposal) to meet the effluent standard while keeping costs manageable.\n\n\nProblem 4.1 (3 points)\nThe flow of wastewater through this treatment system is shown in Figure 1. Modify the edge labels (by editing the edge_labels dictionary in the code producing Figure 1) to show how the wastewater allocations result in the final YUK discharge into Pristine Brook. For the edge_label dictionary, the tuple \\((i, j)\\) corresponds to the arrow going from node \\(i\\) to node \\(j\\). The syntax for any entry is (i, j) =&gt; \"label text\", and the label text can include mathematical notation if the string is prefaced with an L, as in L\"x_1\" will produce \\(x_1\\).\n\n\nusing GraphRecipes, Plots\n\nA = [0 1 1 1;\n    0 0 0 1;\n    0 0 0 1;\n    0 0 0 0]\n\nnames = [\"Plant\", \"Land Treatment\", \"Chem Treatment\", \"Pristine Brook\"]\n# modify this dictionary to add labels\nedge_labels = Dict((1, 2) =&gt; \"\", (1,3) =&gt; \"\", (1, 4) =&gt; \"\",(2, 4) =&gt; \"\",(3, 4) =&gt; \"\")\nshapes=[:hexagon, :rect, :rect, :hexagon]\nxpos = [0, -1.5, -0.25, 1]\nypos = [1, 0, 0, -1]\n\ngraphplot(A, names=names,edgelabel=edge_labels, markersize=0.15, markershapes=shapes, markercolor=:white, x=xpos, y=ypos)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n    \n  \n\n\n\n  \n    \n  \n\n\n\n  \n    \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: System diagram of the wastewater treatment options in Problem 4.\n\n\n\n\n\nProblem 4.2 (4 points)\nFormulate a mathematical model for the treatment cost and the amount of YUK that will be discharged into Pristine Brook based on the wastewater allocations. This is best done with some equations and supporting text explaining the derivation. Make sure you include, as additional equations in the model, any needed constraints on relevant values. You can find some basics on writing mathematical equations using the LaTeX typesetting syntax here, and a cheatsheet with LaTeX commands can be found on the course website’s Resources page.\n\n\nProblem 4.3 (4 points)\nImplement this systems model as a Julia function which computes the resulting YUK concentration and cost for a particular treatment plan.

    "text": "Introduction\nIn this lab, you will use Monte Carlo analysis to estimate the expected winnings for a couple of different games of chance.\nMonte Carlo methods involve the simulation of random numbers from probability distributions. In an environmental context, we often propagate these random numbers through some more complicated model and then compute a resulting statistic which is relevant for assessing performance or risk, such as an average outcome or a particular quantile.\nJulia provides a common interface for probability distributions with the Distributions.jl package. The basic workflow for sampling from a distribution is:\n\nSet up the distribution. The specific syntax depends on the distribution and what parameters are required, but the general call is the similar. For a normal distribution or a uniform distribution, the syntax is\n# you don't have to name this \"normal_distribution\"\n# μ is the mean and σ is the standard deviation\nnormal_distribution = Normal(μ, σ)\n# a is the upper bound and b is the lower bound; these can be set to +Inf or -Inf for an unbounded distribution in one or both directions.\nuniform_distribution = Uniform(a, b)\nThere are lots of both univariate and multivariate distributions, as well as the ability to create your own, but we won’t do anything too exotic here.\nDraw samples. This uses the rand() command (which, when used without a distribution, just samples uniformly from the interval \\([0, 1]\\).) For example, to sample from our normal distribution above:\n# draw n samples\nrand(normal_distribution, n)\n\nPutting this together, let’s say that we wanted to simulate 100 six-sided dice rolls. We could use a Discrete Uniform distribution.\n\ndice_dist = DiscreteUniform(1, 6) # can generate any integer between 1 and 6\ndice_rolls = rand(dice_dist, 100) # simulate rolls\n\n100-element Vector{Int64}:\n 5\n 1\n 4\n 3\n 4\n 2\n 5\n 4\n 6\n 5\n 5\n 5\n 4\n ⋮\n 1\n 5\n 6\n 6\n 1\n 6\n 2\n 5\n 6\n 6\n 1\n 2\n\n\nAnd then we can plot a histogram of these rolls:\n\nhistogram(dice_rolls, legend=:false, bins=6)\nylabel!(\"Count\")\nxlabel!(\"Dice Value\")\n\n\n\n\n  \n    \n  \n\n\n\n  \n    \n  \n\n\n\n  \n    \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRemember to:\n\nEvaluate all of your code cells, in order (using a Run All command).

You will be asked to make a plot of expected winnings by bid for a particular distribution of prize values.\nYou should always start any computing with random numbers by setting a “seed,” which controls the sequence of numbers which are generated (since these are not really random, just “pseudorandom”). In Julia, we do this with the Random.seed!() function.\n\nRandom.seed!(1)\n\nTaskLocalRNG()\n\n\nIt doesn’t matter what seed you set, though different seeds might result in slightly different values.

They then each have to make a bid on the retail price of the showcase. The rules are:\n\nan overbid is an automatic loss;\nthe contest who gets closest to the retail price wins their showcase;\nif a contestant gets within $250 of the retail price and is closer than their opponent, they win both showcases.\n\nYour goal is to find a wager which maximizes your expected winnings, which we may as well call utility, based on your assessment of the probability of your showcase retail price. We’ll assume that the distribution of all showcases offered by the show is given as truncated normal distribution, which means a normal distribution which has an upper and/or lower bound. Distributions.jl makes it easy to specify truncations on any distribution, not just normal distributions.

    "text": "Problems (10 points)\n\nProblem 1: Problem Formulation (5 points)\nIn this problem, you will go through the steps of formulating a linear program for this problem.\n\n\nProblem 1.1 (1 point)\nWhat are your decision variables? Clearly define your notation, including what variables you are using, what they mean, and what their units are.\n\n\nProblem 1.2 (1 point)\nDerive your objective function. Support your function with justifications and/or equations as necessary. You will not receive credit just for the function alone.\n\n\nProblem 1.3 (2 point)\nDerive any needed constraints. Support your function with justifications and/or equations as necessary. You will not receive credit just for the final constraints alone.\n\n\nProblem 1.4 (1 point)\nPut this optimization problem in mathematical programming form. For an example of the syntax for this, see lines 82–91 here.\n\n\nProblem 2: Find the Solution (5 points)\n\nProblem 2.1 (2 points)\nCode your linear program using JuMP. Feel free to consult the website’s JuMP tutorial for syntax help. The keys:\n\n\nInitialize your model with a solver; in this case, we’ll use the HiGHS solver, but there are other solvers listed here for different types of problems, some of which are open and some of which require a commercial license: https://jump.dev/JuMP.jl/stable/installation/#Supported-solvers:\n\nexample_model = Model(HiGHS.Optimizer)\n\nDefine variables with syntax like\n\n@variable(example_model, 1 &gt;= example_x &gt;= 0)\n\nThis will create a variable example_x which is constrained to be between 0 and 1; you can leave off any of the bounds if a variable is unbounded in a particular direction. You can also add a vector of variables:\n\nT = 1:3 # define set to index variables\n@variable(example_model, 1 &gt;= example_z[t in T] &gt;= 0)\n\nwhich will create a vector of 3 variables example_z[1], …, example_z[3], all of which are bounded between 0 and 1.\nAdd an objective with\n\n@objective(example_model, Max, example_x + sum(example_z))\n\nwhich will add an objective to maximize (replace with Min to minimize).\nAdd constraints:\n\n@constraint(example_model, constraint1, 2example_x + 3*sum(example_z) &lt;= 10)\n@constraint(example_model, constraint2, 5example_x - example_z[1] &lt;= 2)\n\nwhich will name the constraints constraint1 and constraint2 (you should make yours more descriptive about what the constraint actually is). The value of adding a name is to facilitate later querying of shadow prices, which we will discuss later. You can also add a vector of constraints which have similar structure or rely on different elements of a data vector:\n\nA = [2; 4]\nb = [8; 12]\nI = 1:2 # set indices for constraint\n@constraint(example_model, vector_constraint[i in I], A[i] * sum(example_z) .&lt;= b[i])\n\nYou can also define matrices of constraints which depend on two index sets by generalizing this syntax, e.g.\n@constraint(example_model, matrix_constraint[i in I, j in J, ...])\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSpecifying higher-dimensional vectors and matrices of variables and constraints will be important when we start looking at more complex applications, so don’t skip over this! You don’t want to manually enter thousands of constraints to ensure hourly electricity demand is met…\n\n\n\nFinally, you can (and probably should) print your model to make sure that you get something that looks like the equations that you wrote down (in a notebook, this will be nicely rendered):\n\nprint(example_model)\n\n\\[ \\begin{aligned}\n\\max\\quad & example\\_x + example\\_z_{1} + example\\_z_{2} + example\\_z_{3}\\\\\n\\text{Subject to} \\quad & 2 example\\_x + 3 example\\_z_{1} + 3 example\\_z_{2} + 3 example\\_z_{3} \\leq 10\\\\\n& 5 example\\_x - example\\_z_{1} \\leq 2\\\\\n& 2 example\\_z_{1} + 2 example\\_z_{2} + 2 example\\_z_{3} \\leq 8\\\\\n& 4 example\\_z_{1} + 4 example\\_z_{2} + 4 example\\_z_{3} \\leq 12\\\\\n& example\\_x \\geq 0\\\\\n& example\\_z_{1} \\geq 0\\\\\n& example\\_z_{2} \\geq 0\\\\\n& example\\_z_{3} \\geq 0\\\\\n& example\\_x \\leq 1\\\\\n& example\\_z_{1} \\leq 1\\\\\n& example\\_z_{2} \\leq 1\\\\\n& example\\_z_{3} \\leq 1\\\\\n\\end{aligned} \\]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDefine your entire model in one cell\n\n\n\nJuMP has great and intuitive syntax, but it doesn’t like re-defining variables or constraints once they’ve been set. I recommend putting all of your model-definition code (starting from model = Model(...)) for a particular optimization problem in a single notebook cell, so you can re-set up the entire problem with a single click when you want to make a change.\n\n\n\n\nProblem 2.2 (1 points)\nFind the solution to your program and find the optimal values of the decision variables. Once you’ve defined your model, you can find the solution with `optimize!():\n\n\noptimize!(example_model)\n\nRunning HiGHS 1.5.3 [date: 1970-01-01, git hash: 45a127b78]\nCopyright (c) 2023 HiGHS under MIT licence terms\nPresolving model\n2 rows, 4 cols, 6 nonzeros\n2 rows, 3 cols, 5 nonzeros\n2 rows, 3 cols, 5 nonzeros\nPresolve : Reductions: rows 2(-2); columns 3(-1); elements 5(-7)\nSolving the presolved LP\nUsing EKK dual simplex solver - serial\n  Iteration        Objective     Infeasibilities num(sum)\n          0     0.0000000000e+00 Ph1: 0(0) 0s\n          2    -3.5333333333e+00 Pr: 0(0) 0s\nSolving the original LP from the solution after postsolve\nModel   status      : Optimal\nSimplex   iterations: 2\nObjective value     :  3.5333333333e+00\nHiGHS run time      :          0.00\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat if I Get An Error?\n\n\n\nIf optimize!() throws an error, that’s usually a sign that something is wrong with the formulation (for example, a variable might not be bounded or a constraint might not be specified correctly) or a typo in the model definition. Linear programs should be well behaved!\n\n\nTo find the values of variables after optimizing, use value.() (the broadcasting ensures this will work for vector-valued variables as well):\n\nvalue.(example_x)\n\n0.6\n\n\n\nvalue.(example_z)\n\n1-dimensional DenseAxisArray{Float64,1,...} with index sets:\n    Dimension 1, 1:3\nAnd data, a 3-element Vector{Float64}:\n 1.0\n 0.9333333333333332\n 1.0\n\n\n\nProblem 2.3 (1 point)\nHow would your profit change if you could buy 1,000 additional bf of spruce?

    "section": "Introduction",
    "text": "Introduction\n\nJulia\nJulia is an up-and-coming language, originally developed for scientific programming. While learning a new programming language always has its hiccups, the good news is that if you’ve programmed in a high-level language such as Python or MATLAB, most Julia concepts should look familiar.\nIf you have not successfully set up Julia, follow the instructions in Tools Setup and/or ask for help.\nYou can use other editors for this course, but our recommendation is Visual Studio Code with the Julia extension, which will make life a lot simpler! You should have set this up by following the Tools Setup instructions, but if not, do so now and/or ask for help.\n\n\nJupyter Notebooks\nJupyter notebooks integrate text and equations in Markdown with Julia (or Python, or R) code. To do this, Jupyter notebooks consist of two types of “cells”: code cells and Markdown (text) cells.\nClick once on this section of text. A box will appear around this text (and some areas above/below it) - all of that is within this cell.\nMarkdown is a text markup framework for formatting language that makes things look pretty when viewed across different platforms: web browsers, notebooks, and so forth. Text written in Markdown can also include hyperlinks, LaTeX equations, section headers, and images, among other features (most of the course website and the lecture notes were all written in Markdown!). Here is a basic Markdown cheat sheet.\nWhat you are looking at right now is the formatted text after the Markdown is processed. To see the raw Markdown, do one of:\n\npress Enter while that cell is selected, or\ndouble-click on that cell.\n\n\nA couple of the features you will see in this Markdown cell:\n\nThe --- command creates a horizontal line. This is also nice for separating sections.\nBackticks (`...`) can be used to format and highlight code, keystrokes, etc.\nThe # sign is used to create a new section header; two # signs (##) is used to create a new subsection header; ### creates a subsubsection, and so on.\nYou can create a bulleted list by using the asterisk * or a dash - and a space.\nYou can create regular text by just typing as usual.\nYou can create bold-faced text by wrapping it with two asterisks on both sides.\nYou can create italicized text by wrapping it with a single asterisk on both sides.\nTo create a new paragraph, you must include a blank line between the old and new paragraphs.\n\nAt this point you might be wondering how to turn this cell back into the fully formatted Markdown text instead of the raw Markdown you’re probably still looking at. You have a couple of options, depending on your platform, but the most consistent is to type Shift + Enter to execute the cell (this is also how to run code, but more on that later).\nAdditionally, you will frequently need to create new cells in your Jupyter notebooks. How you do this will depend on how you interact with the notebook, but try to figure this out now.\nOne tip is to think carefully about what bits of code should be in the same cell, as you typically only see output from the last command in a cell. For example, compare the following:\n\nx = 5\nsin(x)\n\n-0.9589242746631385\n\n\nwith\n\nx = 5\n\n5\n\n\n\nsin(x)\n\n-0.9589242746631385\n\n\nIn Julia, you can also suppress the output of a command with a semi-colon:\n\nsin(x);\n\nwhich can help if you want to split some code out for clarity or to insert some text prior to it, but don’t want to clutter the notebook with its output.\nFor code cells, to execute the commands within the cell, we also press Shift+Enter.\nFinally, make sure that you evaluate all of the code cells in order before submitting. One bad outcome with notebooks occurs when cells are evaluated out of order, so fixed bugs and edits in previous cells do not get a chance to propagate down. You can do this with the Run All command in whichever interface you’re using to edit your notebook.\n\n\nJulia Basics\nThere are many tutorials and references for Julia, including a basics overview on the class website. Please feel free to reference these as you work through any part of the course.\n\n\nFormatting Math\nIt will often be helpful to include nicely-formatted mathematics in a notebook. Markdown accomodates this using LaTeX syntax. A LaTeX cheatsheet is available on the class website, and many other guides exist online.\nBelow is an example of a formatted equation: \\[x = 5.\\]\n\n\nLooking For Help\nThere is no shame in using Google, or other resources, for help when programming. There are many, many times when you can’t quite get the syntax to work, can’t quite figure out the right package or command to use, or are feeling too lazy or overwhelmed (I’m not judging either of those!) to dig through the documentation. Some good resources include:\n\nStack Overflow is a treasure trove of answers;\nThe official Julia forum and the Julia Subreddit are also very useful.\n\nYou are also highly encouraged to post on Ed Discussion, though getting a response might be less immediate. Just be mindful that to get good answers, you have to help people help you, and make sure to give credit to any resources that were helpful!",

This will make sure all output is visible and that the code cells were evaluated in the correct order.\nTag each of the problems when you submit to Gradescope; a 10% penalty will be deducted if this is not done.\n\n\nExercise 1 (3 points)\nGiven two numeric arrays x and y, write a function to compute their dot product if they have equal length, and return an error if not (this is useful for debugging!). Use the following code as a starting point.\n\nfunction dot_product(x, y)\n    if ... # insert test condition for equal lengths\n        # compute and return dot product\n    else\n        throw(DimensionMismatch(\"length of x not equal to length of y\"))\n    end\nend\n\nHere are some tests to make sure your code works as intended.

You will use a while loop instead of the for loop shown above.\nImplement the following algorithm in a function newton_sqrt:\nGiven \\(x &gt; 0\\):\n\nTake a guess \\(a\\).\nDivide \\(x\\) by \\(a\\).\n\nUpdate \\(a\\) as the average of \\(x/a\\) and \\(a\\).\nRepeat until \\(x/a\\) is within a tolerance of \\(\\varepsilon\\) from \\(a\\).\nReturn \\(a \\approx \\sqrt{x}\\).\n\n\n# insert your code here\n\nUse your newton_sqrt function to compute \\(\\sqrt{2}\\) to within a tolerance of \\(\\varepsilon = 0.01\\).\n\n# insert your code here\n\n\n\nExercise 3: Making a Plot (3 points)\nWrite a function to compute the square of an integer x. Evaluate this function for integers between \\(x=-5\\) and \\(x=5\\) and make a plot of the squared values (you can find a quick guide to making various types of plots here).

The utility can build any of the following plant types: geothermal, coal, natural gas combined cycle gas turbine (CCGT), natural gas combustion turbine (CT), solar, and wind.\nWhile coal, CCGT, and CT plants can generate at their full installed capacity, geothermal plants operate at maximum 85% capacity, and solar and wind available capacities vary by the hour depend on the expected meteorology.

Make sure to include any needed derivations or justifications for your equation(s) and define any additional required notation beyond that introduced in Problem 1.1.\n\n\nProblem 1.3 (4 points)\nDerive all relevant constraints. Make sure to include any needed justifications or derivations.\n\n\nProblem 1.4 (3 points)\nImplement your optimization problem in JuMP.\n\n\nProblem 1.5 (5 points)\nFind the optimal solution. How much should the utility build of each type of generating plant? What will the total cost be? How much energy will be non-served?\n\n\nProblem 1.6 (5 points)\nWhat fraction of annual generation does each plant type produce? How does this compare to the breakdown of built capacity that you found in Problem 1.5? Do these results make sense given the generator data?\n\n\nProblem 2 (18 points)\nThe NY state legislature is considering enacting an annual CO2 limit, which for the utility would limit the emissions in its footprint to 1.5 MtCO2/yr.\n\n\nProblem 2.1 (3 points)\nWhat changes are needed to your linear program from Problem 1? Re-formulate the problem and report it in standard form.\n\n\nProblem 2.2 (3 points)\nImplement the new optimization problem in JuMP.\n\n\nProblem 2.3 (5 points)\nFind the optimal solution. How much should the utility build of each type of generating plant? What is different from your plan from Problem 1? Do these changes make sense?\n\n\nProblem 2.4 (5 points)\nWhat fraction of annual generation does each plant type produce? How does this compare to the breakdown of built capacity that you found in Problem 2.3? What are the differences between these results and your plan from Problem 1?\n\n\nProblem 2.5 (2 points)\nWhat would the value to the utility be of allowing it to emit an additional 1000 tCO2/yr?

The oxygen reaeration rate is 0.55 day-1, and the decay rates of CBOD and NBOD are are 0.55 and 0.25 day-1, respectively. The river’s saturated dissolved oxygen concentration is 10m g/L.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Schematic of the system\n\n\n\n\nProblem 1 (8 points)\nIf the characteristics of the river inflow and waste discharges are given in Table 1, write a Julia model to compute the dissolved oxygen concentration from the first wastewater discharge to an arbitrary distance d km downstream.

What do you notice?\n\n\nProblem 3 (3 points)\nUnder the assumptions of Problem 1, determine the distance from waste stream 2 it will take for the dissolved oxygen concentration of the river to recover to 6 mg/L.\n\n\nProblem 4 (5 points)\nWhat is the minimum level of treatment (% removal of organic waste) for waste stream 2 that will ensure that the dissolved oxygen concentration never drops below 4 mg/L, assuming that waste stream 1 remains untreated?\n\n\nProblem 5 (5 points)\nIf both waste streams are treated equally, what is the minimum level of treatment (% removal of organic waste) for the two sources required to ensure that the dissolved oxygen concentration never drops below 4 mg/L?\n\n\nProblem 6 (5 points)\nSuppose you are responsible for designing a waste treatment plan for discharges into the river, with a regulatory mandate to keep the dissolved oxygen concentration above 4 mg/L. Discuss whether you’d opt to treat waste stream 2 alone or both waste streams equally. What other information might you need to make a conclusion, if any?\n\n\nProblem 7 (5 points)\nSuppose that it is known that the DO concentrations at the river inflow can vary uniformly between 6 mg/L and 8 mg/L. How often will the treatment plan identified in Problem 5 (both waste streams treated equally) fail to comply with the regulatory standard?\n\n\nProblem 8 (5 points)\nA factory is planning a third wastewater discharge into the river downstream of the second plant. This discharge would consist of 5 m3/day of wastewater with a dissolved oxygen content of 4.5 mg/L and CBOD and NBOD levels of 50 and 45 mg/L, respectively.\nAssume that the treatment plan you identified in Problem 5 is still in place for the existing discharges. If the third discharge will not be treated, under the original inflow conditions (7.5 mg/L DO), how far downstream from the second discharge does this third discharge need to be placed to keep the river concentration from dropping below 4 mg/L?",

The wastewater contains \\(1 \\text{kg/m}^3\\) of YUK, a toxic substance. The US Environmental Protection Agency has imposed an effluent standard on the plant prohibiting discharge of more than \\(20 \\text{kg/day}\\) of YUK into Pristine Brook.\nCheap Plastic Products has analyzed two methods for reducing its discharges of YUK. Method 1 is land disposal, which costs \\(X_1^2/20\\) dollars per day, where \\(X_1\\) is the amount of wastewater disposed of on the land (\\(\\text{m}^3\\text{/day}\\)). With this method, 20% of the YUK applied to the land will eventually drain into the stream (i.e., 80% of the YUK is removed by the soil).\nMethod 2 is a chemical treatment procedure which costs $1.50 per \\(\\text{m}^3\\) of wastewater treated. The chemical treatment has an efficiency of \\(e= 1 - 0.005X_2\\), where \\(X_2\\) is the quantity of wastewater (\\(\\text{m}^3\\text{/day}\\)) treated. For example, if \\(X_2 = 50 \\text{m}^3\\text{/day}\\), then \\(e = 1 - 0.005(50) = 0.75\\), so that 75% of the YUK is removed.\nCheap Plastic Products is wondering how to allocate their wastewater between these three disposal and treatment methods (land disposal, and chemical treatment, and land disposal) to meet the effluent standard while keeping costs manageable.\n\nProblem 4.1 (3 points)\nThe flow of wastewater through this treatment system is shown in Figure 1. Modify the edge labels (by editing the edge_labels dictionary in the code producing Figure 1) to show how the wastewater allocations result in the final YUK discharge into Pristine Brook. For the edge_label dictionary, the tuple \\((i, j)\\) corresponds to the arrow going from node \\(i\\) to node \\(j\\). The syntax for any entry is (i, j) =&gt; \"label text\", and the label text can include mathematical notation if the string is prefaced with an L, as in L\"x_1\" will produce \\(x_1\\).\nSolution:\n\nusing GraphRecipes, Plots\n\nA = [0 1 1 1;\n    0 0 0 1;\n    0 0 0 1;\n    0 0 0 0]\n\nnames = [\"Plant\", \"Land Treatment\", \"Chem Treatment\", \"Pristine Brook\"]\n# modify this dictionary to add labels\nedge_labels = Dict((1, 2) =&gt; L\"X_1\", (1,3) =&gt; L\"X_2\", (1, 4) =&gt; L\"100-X_1-X_2\", (2, 4) =&gt; L\"0.2 X_1\",(3, 4) =&gt; L\"0.005 X_2^2\")\nshapes=[:hexagon, :rect, :rect, :hexagon]\nxpos = [0, -1.5, -0.25, 1]\nypos = [1, 0, 0, -1]\n\ngraphplot(A, names=names,edgelabel=edge_labels, markersize=0.15,\n    markershapes=shapes, markercolor=:white, x=xpos, y=ypos)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n    \n  \n\n\n\n  \n    \n  \n\n\n\n  \n    \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: System diagram of the wastewater treatment options in Problem 4.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProblem 4.2 (4 points)\nFormulate a mathematical model for the treatment cost and the amount of YUK that will be discharged into Pristine Brook based on the wastewater allocations. This is best done with some equations and supporting text explaining the derivation. Make sure you include, as additional equations in the model, any needed constraints on relevant values. You can find some basics on writing mathematical equations using the LaTeX typesetting syntax here, and a cheatsheet with LaTeX commands can be found on the course website’s Resources page.\nSolution:\nThese equations will be derived in terms of \\(X_1\\) and \\(X_2\\), where \\(X_1 + X_2 \\leq 100\\).\nThe amount of YUK which will be discharged is \\[\nD(X_1, X_2) = 100 - X_1 - X_2 + 0.2 X_1 + 0.005X_2^2 = 100 - 0.8 X_1 + (0.005X_2 - 1)X_2.\n\\]\nThe cost is \\[\nC(X_1, X_2) = X_1^2/20 + 1.5 X_2.\n\\]\n\n\nProblem 4.3 (4 points)\nImplement this systems model as a Julia function which computes the resulting YUK concentration and cost for a particular treatment plan. You can return multiple values from a function with a tuple, as in:\n\nfunction multiple_return_values(x, y)\n    return (x+y, x*y)\nend\n\na, b = multiple_return_values(2, 5)\n@show a;\n@show b;\n\na = 7\nb = 10\n\n\nMake sure you comment your code appropriately to make it clear what is going on and why.\nSolution:\n\n# we will assume that X₁, X₂ are vectors so we can vectorize\n# the function; hence the use of broadcasting. This makes unpacking\n# the different outputs easier as each will be returned as a vector.\n# Note that even though this is vectorized, passing scalar inputs\n# will still work fine.\nfunction yuk_discharge(X₁, X₂)\n    # Make sure X₁ + X₂ &lt;= 100! Throw an error if not.\n    if any(X₁ .+ X₂ .&gt; 100)\n        error(\"X₁ + X₂ must be less than 100\")\n    end\n    # These calculations use broadcasting\n    yuk = 100 .- 0.8X₁ .+ (0.005X₂ .- 1) .* X₂\n    cost = X₁.^2/20 .+ 1.5X₂\n    return (yuk, cost)\nend\n\nyuk_discharge (generic function with 1 method)\n\n\n\n\nProblem 4.4 (5 points)\nUse your function to experiment with some different combinations of wastewater discharge and treatment. Can you find one that satisfies the YUK effluent standard? What was the cost? You don’t have to find an “optimal” solution to this problem, but what do you think would be needed to find a better solution?\nSolution:\nWe left this intentionally open for you to conceptualize how to generate combinations and to look into different ways of implementing these in Julia.

    "text": "Problems (Total: 40 Points)\n\nProblem 1 (12 points)\nRecall from class that the simple energy balance model (EBM) of planetary energy balance links changes in radiative forcing (\\(F\\)) to global mean temperature (\\(T\\)) changes through the discretized equation \\[T_{i+1} = T_{i} + \\frac{F_i - \\lambda T_i}{cd} \\times \\Delta t,\\] where \\(i\\) is the current time step, \\(c = 4.184 \\times 10^6\\) J/K/m2 is the heat capacity of water per unit area, \\(d\\) is the (uncertain) depth of the mixing layer, \\(\\Delta t\\) is the annual time step in seconds and \\(\\lambda = F_{\\text{2xCO}_2}/S\\) is the climate feedback parameter in W/m2/\\(^\\circ\\) C, where \\(S\\) is the equilibrium climate sensitivity (the uncertain equilibrium temperature change resulting from a doubling of atmospheric CO2). Finally, while total radiative forcing can be the result of non-aerosol and aerosol effects, we do not know the relative intensity of aerosol forcing, so we represent this with an uncertain aerosol scaling factor \\(\\alpha\\).\nWe can implement this model with the following Julia function. We will assume an ocean mixing depth \\(d = 100\\) m and an aerosol scaling factor \\(\\alpha = 1.3\\) so we can focus on the uncertainty in \\(S\\).\nThe last technical concern is that “global mean temperature” does not make sense in absolute terms as a marker of climate change. Instead, we typically refer to temperature changes relative to some historical pre-industrial baseline. In this case, we will use the period from 1880-1900, though this choice can vary.\n\n\n# we need to split up the aerosol and non-aerosol forcings when we call the function\nfunction energy_balance_model(S, forcing_aerosol, forcing_non_aerosol)\n    d = 100 # ocean mixing depth [m]\n    α = 1.3 # aerosol scaling factor\n    F2xCO₂ = 4.0 # radiative forcing [W/m²] for a doubling of CO₂\n    λ = F2xCO₂/S\n    \n    c = 4.184e6 # heat capacity/area [J/K/m²]\n    C = c*d # heat capacity of mixed layer (per area)\n\n    F = forcing_non_aerosol + α*forcing_aerosol # radiative forcing\n\n    Δt = 31558152.0 # annual timestep [s]\n    \n    T = zero(F)\n    for i in 1:length(F)-1\n        T[i+1] = T[i] + (F[i] - λ*T[i])/C * Δt\n    end\n    # return temperature anomaly relative to 1880-1900 baseline\n    return T .- mean(T[1:21]) \nend\n\nenergy_balance_model (generic function with 1 method)\n\n\nFinally, we need to load some radiative forcing data. We will use the radiative forcing scenario RCP 8.5. We can load this data, which is in a .csv (comma-delimited) file, into a DataFrame, which is a tabular data structure. Rows and columns in a DataFrame can be accessed using their numerical index (like a matrix), but columns also have names; you can access a particular column in a dataframe df by name using df.colname or df[:, \"colname\"].\nOf note: this data set goes from 1750–2500, so you will need to take care to make sure you are using the right years at each step. For example, here we will constrain the data to 1880–2100, which is the period we are interested in.\n\n# The CSV is read into a DataFrame object, and we specify that it is comma delimited\nforcings_all_85 = CSV.read(\"data/ERF_ssp585_1750-2500.csv\", DataFrame, delim=\",\")\n\n# get the years corresponding to the forcings\nt = Int64.(forcings_all_85[!,\"year\"]) # Ensure that years are interpreted as integers\n# find the indices of the years 1880 and 2100\n# we can do this with the indexin function\ntime_bounds = indexin([1880, 2100], t)\nyears = time_bounds[1]:time_bounds[2] # create range of years\n\n# Separate out the individual components\nforcing_co2_85 = forcings_all_85[years,\"co2\"]\n# Get total aerosol and non-aerosol forcings\nforcing_aerosol_rad_85 = forcings_all_85[years,\"aerosol-radiation_interactions\"]\nforcing_aerosol_cloud_85 = forcings_all_85[years,\"aerosol-cloud_interactions\"]\nforcing_aerosol_85 = forcing_aerosol_rad_85 + forcing_aerosol_cloud_85 # aerosol forcings\nforcing_total_85 = forcings_all_85[years,\"total\"] \nforcing_non_aerosol_85 = forcing_total_85 - forcing_aerosol_85 # non-aerosol forcings\n\n221-element Vector{Float64}:\n  0.42741479112315905\n  0.4487940147601447\n  0.4900144276528058\n -0.019811270078689047\n -1.480725700367619\n -0.3154905163510021\n  0.233186559774844\n  0.2923308952663089\n  0.45833872365810924\n  0.5168189581089915\n  0.4144761329626494\n  0.2762327724171124\n  0.48656957869238376\n  ⋮\n  9.560222650653953\n  9.671039126229665\n  9.772610821460296\n  9.879065698371564\n  9.946850640754889\n 10.002169546141578\n 10.061009359425011\n 10.115684195707905\n 10.182946497594184\n 10.249699157847772\n 10.331407709334023\n 10.424544495740134\n\n\nFor this assignment, you can use the forcing_aerosol_85 and forcing_non_aerosol_85 vectors as is to correspond to the relevant forcings.

One simple way to represent this link is through the following model, proposed by Rahmstorf (2007).\n\\[\\frac{dH}{dt} = a(T-T_0),\\] where \\(H\\) is the global mean sea level in mm, \\(T\\) is global mean temperature, \\(T_0\\) is an equilibrium temperature (where there is no change in sea levels), and \\(a\\) is a proportionality constant. This model can be discretized to give \\[H_{i+1} - H_i = a (T_i - T_0).\\]\nNote that, like with global mean temperature, the notion of “global mean sea level” does not make sense in absolute terms (were sea levels ever at “zero”?). Instead, we want to normalize this relative to some historical baseline. In this case (with a view towards Problem 3), we will compute our sea levels relative to the 2010 sea level. Note that in addition to the model parameters, we also need an initial sea-level parameter \\(H_0\\) which will give us the right anomaly level.\nThe best estimates for these parameters are:\n\n\\(a = 1.86\\);\n\\(H_0 = -223\\);\n\\(T_0 = -0.62\\)\n\n\n\nProblem 2.1 (5 points)\nWrite a function sea_level_model() to implement the mathematical sea-level rise model described above.

This might suggest that ignoring this uncertainty could result in an under-estimation of the worst-case risks associated with sea-level rise. Further, as there is a larger amount of probability mass above this level than below it due to the distribution’s skew, it is more likely that we under-estimate the resulting risks than over-estimate.\n\nProblem 3 (13 points)\nYou’ve been asked to consult on a levee reliability analysis. For context, levees in the United States are supposed to only fail once in 100 years, or, in other words, to have at most a 1% chance of failure in a given year. We will assume for this problem that the only way in which a levee fails is by being overtopped (note: this is unrealistic).\nWe can assess the probability of levee overtopping by comparing its height to a distribution of extreme sea levels. A common approach is to look at the distribution of the highest sea level each year. These extreme sea levels can be obtained by combining the absolute sea level (we will use our distribution of global sea levels for this), the rate of subsidence (how much the ground sinks), and the distribution of storm tides (the highest tide level, which is often the result of storm surges combining with high tide).\nAssume for this problem that:\n\nthe annual rate of subsidence \\(\\nu\\) is 1.2mm/yr;\nthe distribution of annual storm tide maxima, above the mean sea level, is (and is expected to continue to be) given by a \\(\\text{GeneralizedExtremeValue}(900, 25, 0.3)\\) distribution, which looks like this:\n\n\ntide_distribution = GeneralizedExtremeValue(900, 25, 0.3)\n    histogram(rand(tide_distribution, 10000), xlabel=\"Storm Tide Height (mm)\", ylabel=\"Count\", legend=:false)\n\n\n\n\n  \n    \n  \n\n\n\n  \n    \n  \n\n\n\n  \n    \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFeel free to just sample from tide_distribution in your solution below.\n\n\nProblem 3.1 (2 points)\nHow would you use your sea-level simulations and the above information to compute a distribution of extreme sea levels in 2100 relative to 2010 mean sea level? Write down the approach in clear steps, with equations as needed.\n\nSolution:\n\nWe start with our distribution of global sea levels in 2100 (relative to the 2010 mean sea level from Problem 2).\nFor each of these (call a given realization \\(H_n\\)), we need to add the amount of subsidence from 2010 through 2100, which is \\(\\nu \\times (2100 - 2010 + 1)\\).\nWe then draw 10,000 samples \\(x_n\\) of a storm tide maximum from the given distribution.\n\nThen a single simulation of a storm tide is \\(H_n + \\nu_n \\times (2100 - 2010 + 1) + x_n\\), and we have obtained a distribution of 10,000 of these through this procedure.\n\nProblem 3.2 (3 points)\nFollow the steps above and produce a histogram of the extreme sea levels in 2100 relative to 2010.\n\nSolution:\n\nν = 1.2 * (2100 - 2010 + 1) # total subsdience from 2010 through 2100\nstorm_tide_max = rand(tide_distribution, 10000) # storm tide extremes\nsea_level_max = H[:, end] + storm_tide_max .+ ν\nhistogram(sea_level_max, legend=:false, xlabel=\"Extreme Sea Levels in 2100 (mm)\", ylabel=\"Count\")\n\n\n\n\n  \n    \n  \n\n\n\n  \n    \n  \n\n\n\n  \n    \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProblem 3.3 (5 points)\nThe current levee was heightened in 2010 to 2m above the 2010 mean sea level. Based on your analysis above, what is the probability that the levee will be overtopped in 2100 (remember that the reliability standard is 1%)?\n\nSolution:\nWe need to see how often our samples exceed 2m. We can do this by broadcasting or with a loop. Remember to account for the conversion from m to mm!\n\n# broadcast over samples and find values exceeding 2m\nexceedances = sea_level_max .&gt; 2000\nprob_exceedance = sum(exceedances) / length(sea_level_max)\n\n0.0473\n\n\nSo we can estimate that the levee could be overtopped with a 5% probability in 2100, which is well below the reliability standard.\n\nProblem 3.4 (3 points)\nBased on your analysis, would you recommend that the levee be heightened again in the future, and if so, how high? What other information might you need, if any, to make your recommendation?\n\nSolution: It seems that the levee should be re-heightened, but the level will depend on a number of factors, so there are many acceptable answers, depending on cost (do you just build to reach the 1% standard or build higher?) and possible damages in the event of a flood (based on the anticipated exposure and vulnerability in the future)."

Please do not forget to do this before exporting and submitting or you may lose points because your code has not been executed or may have errors.\nClick the ellipsis (“…”) and select “Export”. If you have LaTeX installed, you can click “PDF”; otherwise, click “HTML.” Save the file, and then when prompted, open the file. This should open the page in your browser; go to the print interface and save as a PDF. ::: {.callout-tip} When printing to PDF, long lines will run off the edge of code cells, which may result in comments or code being hidden. If you see this, go back to the notebook and break up long lines into shorter onces (for example, see the comment in the above code cell) to ensure key parts of your results aren’t missing. :::\n\nGreat! That’s the basic workflow for every assignment in this course.\nNow you have your PDF that you can submit to Gradescope. Make sure that you tag pages corresponding to relevant problems to avoid a 10% penalty."

The large mass of plants and algae have several noxious effects on the ecosystem, including:\n\nhypoxia (reduction in oxygen from the decomposition of organic matter), leading to “dead zones”;\nacidification (from the CO2 produced by decomposition);\nreduced sunlight (from an accumulation of surface algae);\nclogged water intakes; and\nreduction in recreational value and drinking water quality.\n\nIn lakes, eutrophication is often caused by excess input of nutrients (particularly phosphorous, P), which can come from point sources (such as industrial processes) and/or non-point sources (such as agricultural runoff). As the P releases are related to economic activity, we can view this (simplified) lake management problem from the perspective of a tradeoff between economic benefits and the health of the lake: while there are benefits to the activities which lead to P releases, there are recreational, aesthetic, and ecological benefits to maintaining the lake in a non-eutrophic (or oligotrophic) state.\n\n\nModel Formulation\nSuppose we have a town which emits phosphorous into a lake as a by-product of economic activity. The level of P in the lake at a given time \\(t\\) is given by \\(X_t\\) (for the purposes of this problem, we will just treat all values as dimensionless).\nThe level of controllable P release in year \\(t\\) is \\(a_t\\). The lake also receives random levels of phosphorous from non-point source runoff, which we denote by \\(y_t\\). We model these random runoffs using a lognormal distribution \\(LogNormal(\\mu, \\sigma^2)\\), which ensures that the runoffs cannot be negative.\nThere is also some nutrient cycling in the lake which naturally reduces phosphorous concentrations. This cycling is the result of accumulation in the sediment and turnover (water motion disturbing the sediment and carrying the nutrients upwards) and consumers, such as mussels. This cycling is dependent on the state \\(X_t\\), \\(\\frac{X_t^q}{1 + X_t^q}\\). The lake also loses some of its P each time period of its due to outflows and consumption, which we assume is linearly proportional to the state, \\(bX_t\\).\n\n\n\nShallow Lake Problem Diagram\n\n\nAs a result, the lake dynamics are given by:\n\\[X_{t+1} = X_t + a_t + y_t + \\frac{X_t^q}{1 + X_t^q} - bX_t, \\quad y_t \\sim LogNormal(\\mu, \\sigma^2),\\]\nwhere parameter interpretation is given in the table below.\n\nLake problem parameters\n\n\nParameter\nDefinition\nUnits\n\n\n\n\n\\(X_t\\)\nP concentration in lake\ndimensionless\n\n\n\\(a_t\\)\npoint source P input\ndimensionless\n\n\n\\(y_t\\)\nnon-point source P input\ndimensionless\n\n\n\\(q\\)\nP recycling rate\ndimensionless\n\n\n\\(b\\)\nrate at which P is lost\ndimensionless"

The black line is the P recycling level (for $q=2.5), which adds P back into the lake, and the dashed lines correspond to differerent rates of P outflow (based on the linear parameter \\(b\\)). The lake P level is in equilibrium when the recycling rate equals the outflows. When the outflow is greater than the recycling flux, the lake’s P level decreases, and when the recycling flux is greater than the outflow, the P level naturally increases. The red lines show the direction of this net flux.\n\n\n\n\nBased on Figure 1, we can see that there are typically three equilibria: a stable equilibrium at \\(X=0\\), an unstable, oligotrophic equilibrium \\(X_o\\), and a stable, eutrophic equilibrium \\(X_e\\). When \\(X_t &lt; X_o\\), the lake tends towards a zero P level without external inputs, while when \\(X_t &gt; X_o\\), the lake will inevitably undergo eutrophication, as the P level will tend towards \\(X_e\\). This means that \\(X_t=X_o\\) corresponds to a tipping point: beyond that level, the lake will abruptly switch to a eutrophic state from which it cannot recover.\nThis lake is subject to a bifurcation depending on the values of \\(b\\) and \\(q\\). To see this, let’s fix \\(q=2.5\\), as in Figure 1. For \\(b=0.4\\), there are the two equilibria mentioned previously. However, when \\(b=0.2\\), there is only the unstable equilibrium \\(X=X_o\\) in addition to \\(X=0\\). For \\(b=0.6\\), the only equilibrium is \\(X=0\\), so any positive P input would result in eutrophication. This highlights the delicacy of systems which exhibit bifurcations: whether an equilibrium is stable or unstable, or even exists, can depend on a characteristic of the system which is often highly uncertain.\n\neq = [0, 0.67, 2.2]\nscatter!(p1, eq, (y -&gt; lake_P_cycling(y, 2.5)).(eq), label=\"Equilibria\", markersize=10, markercolor=:red)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n    \n  \n\n\n\n  \n    \n  \n\n\n  \n    \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Lake eutrophication dynamics based on the shallow lake modelwithout additional inputs.

The class schedule will link to a page which has a preview of the assignment, but links are not provided from this page to accept the assignment.\nFor the first assignment you accept, you will need to link your GitHub account to your entry in the class roster. You will not need to do this again for the rest of the semester.\n\n\nWhat if there’s an error in the assignment repository?\nThat’s certainly possible! If you believe I’ve made a mistake in writing the assignment, please document it in the Ed Discussion forum. I’ll describe steps for how to fix your files (unfortunately, I can’t do this remotely and push it to everyone’s repositories).\n\n\nHelp! My code isn’t working.\nHere are some steps I would follow:\n\nSearch for the error message you’re seeing. Often, you can find posts in the r/Julia subreddit, the official Julia forum, or Stack Overflow for the same or similar issues. You should do this first: if you can find the answer this way, it will be faster than other options, and if you can rule out some approaches that you’ve already tried, it will make the following steps go more smoothly.\nPost on Ed Discussion. For the most effective help, follow the following guidelines (adapted from Stack Overflow’s “How Do I Ask A Good Question?”):\n\nMake your post subject specific and descriptive. “Problem with HW 1 Problem 3” makes it hard for other members of the class community to know if they’re having a similar issue or if they can help. Since the TA and I may not be checking Ed religiously, you’ll get faster responses if other students feel prepared to help.\nIntroduce the problem. What have you tried? What error message are you getting? Have you been able to identify a specific line of code or section of code that’s causing the problem?\nProvide code. It’s very difficult to get a sense of what might be going wrong if you just say that you have a problem, even if you share the error message. If you have a small question (you can demonstrate the error with a brief snippet of code), you can directly put this into your Ed post, but otherwise, please provide a link to your GitHub repository and where to find the relevant codes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n## Update Your Repository!\nYou must commit and push your current files to GitHub prior to asking for help, or we won’t be able to see the code that you’re having trouble with.\n\n\n\n\nCome to office hours. If you can identify the problem, but we’re having trouble solving it via Ed or more urgency is required, please come to office hours and we can try to work through the issue. This is most helpful if you’ve already done some problem-solving on your own.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n## Give Yourself Time To Problem-Solve\nWaiting until the last day or two to start an assignment can cause problems if you don't have time to work through the following steps. If office hours are busy and you haven't gone through the prior steps, you may be prioritized below than students who are have, and we may not have time to solve your problem. **Running into coding challenges is not a valid reason to get an extension on an assignment!**\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow do I get a PDF of my notebook for submission?\nThere are two main options, depending on what you’ve already got set up on your computer.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRun Notebook Cells Before Submission\n\n\n\nRemember to “Run All” cells prior to conversion and submission, or else we won’t see your results!\n\n\n\nIf you have a Python installation, you can use a tool called nbconvert to convert to a PDF (if you also have LaTeX installed) or HTML (and then you can use your browser to print to a PDF).\nIf you don’t have a Python installation, within VS Code, you can use IJulia.jl (which will be included in the environments provided with assignments in this class) as follows (enter these commands into the REPL) to open your notebook in your browser:\nusing IJulia\nnotebook()\nThis should open a Jupyter notebook interface in your browser. Navigate to and open the notebook, and once it has completed running, go to File -&gt; Print Preview in the browser menu and Print to PDF.\n\n\n\nHow do I submit my PDF to Gradescope?\nThe instructions for submitting your assignment to Gradescope can be found here.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTag Pages\n\n\n\nMake sure that you mark/tag the pages corresponding to each question! Otherwise, we will deduct 10%. If a problem spans multiple pages, tag them all; if a page includes multiple problems, tag it several times.",

    "section": "Making a Basic Plot",
    "text": "Making a Basic Plot\nLet’s walk through making a basic line or scatter plot in Julia, using Plots.jl1.\n1 There are some other plotting libraries in Julia, but Plots.jl is a standard starting point. Feel free to experiment, though!Since we’ll be generating random numbers, let’s import Random.jl to let us set a seed to reproduce the same plot in addition to Plots.jl.\n\nusing Plots\nusing LaTeXStrings\nusing Measures\nusing Random\nRandom.seed!(1);\n\nFirst, to generate a basic line plot, use plot():\n\ny = rand(5)\nplot(y, label=\"original data\", legend=:topleft)\n\n\n\n\n  \n    \n  \n\n\n\n  \n    \n  \n\n\n\n  \n    \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe could also explicitly pass \\(x\\)-axis coordinates by passing an array with these coordinates first, as in plot(x, y, ...). If only one array is passed, Plots.jl will interpret the values as \\(y\\) coordinates and use their indices for the \\(x\\) positions.\nNotice the use of the label and legend keywords to label the plot element and position the legend. To not label a particular plotting element, use label=false, and to turn off any legend (including a colorbar) from the plot, use legend=false.\nNow we can add some other lines and point markers. We will use plot! and scatter! to add another line and some points.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMutating Function\n\n\n\nThe exclamation mark says that plot!() is a mutating function, which changes an existing variable instead of creating a new one. In this case, these functions change or add to an existing plot, instead of creating a new one.\n\n\nNotice the arguments in plot!() and scatter!(), which let us set properties for the line and scatterplot markers.\n\ny2 = rand(5)\ny3 = rand(5)\nplot!(y2, color=:red, linewidth=2, linestyle=:dot, label=\"new data\")\nscatter!(y3, markercolor=:black, markershape=:square, markersize=5, label=\"even more data\")\n\n\n\n\n  \n    \n  \n\n\n\n  \n    \n  \n\n\n\n  \n    \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLet’s now add axis labels. We can use LaTeX syntax to add mathematical markup elements to labels (such as superscripts, subscripts, Greek letters, and mathematical symbols) using the LaTeXStrings.jl package. If we indicate that a string should be interpreted as a LaTeXString using the L\"...\" syntax, it will render content inside $..$ using LaTeX, as seen below.\n\nxlabel!(\"Regular String (days)\")\nylabel!(L\"LaTeX String $x_2$ (m$^3$)\")\n\n\n\n\n  \n    \n  \n\n\n\n  \n    \n  \n\n\n  \n    \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRemoving Plot Elements\nSometimes we want to remove legends, axes, grid lines, and/or ticks.\n\nplot!(legend=false, axis=false, grid=false, ticks=false)\n\n\n\n\n  \n    \n  \n\n\n\n  \n    \n  \n\n\n  \n    \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNotice that this unintentionally modified the image dimensions to move the axis labels off the page. If we wanted to keep them, we could modify the dimensions with plot!(size=...).\n\nplot!(size=(400, 400))\n\n\n\n\n  \n    \n  \n\n\n\n  \n    \n  \n\n\n  \n    \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe lesson is that sometimes the Plots.jl defaults don’t look ideal, and we need to adjust sizes and margins.\n\n\nAspect Ratio\nIf we want to have a square aspect ratio, use ratio = 1.\n\nv = rand(5)\nplot(v, ratio=1, legend=false)\nscatter!(v)",

    "text": "Instructions\n\nInstall Git\nIf you have already installed git, you don’t need to worry about this section. If you haven’t, download the appropriate version for your operating system.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMac Versions\n\n\n\nIf you have a Mac, be aware if you have an Apple Silicon (M1 or M2) Mac or an Intel Mac. Many of the installations you will go through in this exercise have different versions for each processor type, and the program may not work properly if you still the wrong version. There’s nothing that can’t be undone, but it’s easier to be install the correct version first!\n\n\n\n\nInstall Julia\nI recommend installing Julia using the juliaup tool, which will let you easily manage versions in the future and works seamlessly with VS Code. The instructions can be found at the JuliaUp GitHub repository, but we will summarize them here.\n\nInstalling Juliaup on Windows\nIf your computer uses Windows, you can install Juliaup from the Windows Store.\n\n\nInstalling Juliaup on MacOS\nIf you have a Mac, open a terminal (such as the Terminal app) and enter:\ncurl -fsSL https://install.julialang.org | sh\n\n\nInstalling Julia 1.9.2\nOnce you install Juliaup, install Julia version 1.9.2 by opening a terminal (in MacOS or Linux) or the command line (in Windows) and entering:\njuliaup add 1.9.2\njuliaup default 1.9.2\nThis will install Julia 1.9.2 and make it the default version, which should maximize package compatibility throughout this course. Going forward, if you want to add new versions or change the default, you can follow the Juliaup instructions.\n\n\n\nInstall and Set Up VS Code\nYou can skip this section if you already have a coding environment you like; just set it up to work with Julia. Otherwise, VS Code is as close to an officially supported editor for Julia as you can get. We will follow this guide for setting up VS Code with Julia.\n\nInstalling VS Code\nYou can download it here; open the downloaded file to install.\n\n\nInstall the Julia Extension\n\nOpen VS Code.\nSelect View and click Extensions to open the Extension View. This view can also be found on the sidebar with the following logo:\n.\nSearch for julia in the search box. Click the green install button.\nRestart VS Code once the installation is complete. It should automatically find your Julia installation; talk to Vivek if not.\n\nThe Julia VS Code extension offers you some nice features. You can start a REPL (an interactive Julia coding environment) by opening the “Command Palette” (View -&gt; Command Palette, or CTRL/CMD+SHIFT+P) and typing “REPL” to bring up “Julia: Start REPL”. You can also create *.jl files to write Julia code and execute line by line. However, we will primarily use Jupyter notebooks in this class, but this might be useful for testing code or for your project.\n\n\nInstall the Jupyter Notebook Extension\nThe Jupyter Notebook extension allows you to export a Jupyter notebook to PDF or to HTML and then to PDF.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPDF Export for Gradescope\n\n\n\nYou will need to export every notebook to a PDF for submission to Gradescope. Direct export to PDF requires a LaTeX installation. If you would like to go this route, please look at the LaTeX installation instructions for your operating system.\nOtherwise, exporting to HTML and then using your browser to save the resulting page to a PDF is a perfect solution.\n\n\nFollow the same instructions as above, but search for jupyter and install the Jupyter extension. Restart VS Code.\n\n\n\nSet Up GitHub\n\nCreate GitHub Account\nIf you already have a GitHub account, you can use that for this course and do not need to create a new account.\nOtherwise, create an account. It doesn’t have to be linked to your Cornell email or use your Cornell NetID.\nFor labs and homework assignments (we will work on Lab 1 in class on Friday and Homework 1 is available), you should use the GitHub Classroom link to “accept” the assignment provided on Ed Discussion, which will give you your own GitHub repository for that assignment. The first time you click one of these links, you will need to link your place on the course roster with your GitHub account.\nWhen application exercises require notebook use (which is the case here, but will not always be), you can follow the workflow in these next steps, and will be prompted to do so in the instructions for that exercise.\nYou can do almost everything that you will need to do for this course with GitHub directly through VS Code, or you can use the GitHub UI or the Terminal. We will assume in these instructions that you will just work through VS Code.",
