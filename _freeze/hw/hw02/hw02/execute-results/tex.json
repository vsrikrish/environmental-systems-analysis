CRUD decays exponentially in the river at a rate of 0.36 $\\mathrm{d}^{-1}$. \n:::\n\n![Schematic of the river system in Problem 1](figures/river_diagram.png)\n\n::: {.cell .markdown}\n**In this problem**:\n\n* Assuming steady-state conditions, derive a model for the concentration of CRUD downriver by solving the appropriate differential equation(s) analytically.\n* Determine if the system in compliance with a regulatory limit of 2.5 kg/(1000 m$^3$).\n:::\n\n::: {.callout-tip}\nFormulate your model in terms of distance downriver, rather than leaving it in terms of time from discharge.\n:::\n\n### Problem 2 (25 points)\n\nConsider the shallow lake model from class:\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\nX_{t+1} &= X_t + a_t + y_t + \\frac{X_t^q}{1 + X_t^q} - bX_t, \\\\\ny_t &\\sim \\text{LogNormal}(\\mu, \\sigma^2),\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nwhere:\n\n* $X_t$ is the lake phosphorous (P) concentration at time $t$;\n* $a_t$ is the point-source P release at time $t$;\n* $y_t$ is the non-point-source P release at time $t$, which is treated as random from a LogNormal distribution with mean $\\mu$ and standard deviation $\\sigma$;\n* $b$ is the linear rate of P outflow;\n* $q$ is a parameter influencing the rate of P recycling from the sediment.\n\n\n**In this problem**:\n\n* Make an initial conditions plot for the model dynamics for $b=0.5$, $q=1.5$, $y_t=0$, and $a_t=0$ for $t=0, \\ldots, 30$. What are the equilibria? What can you say about the resilience of the system?\n  \n  ::: {.callout-tip}\n  ## Finding equilibria\n  \n  Use [`Roots.jl`](https://juliamath.github.io/Roots.jl/stable/) to find the equilibria by solving for values where $X_{t+1} = X_t$. For example, if you have functions `X_outflow(X,b)` and `X_recycling(X,q)`, you could create a function `X_delta(x, a) = a + X_recycling(x) - X_outflow(x)` and call `Roots.find_zero(x -> X_delta(x, a), x₀)`, where `x₀` is an initial value for the search (you might need to use your plot to find values for `x₀` near each of the \"true\" equilibria).\n\n  :::\n\n* Repeat the analysis with $a_t=0.02$ for all $t$. What are the new equilibria? How have the dynamics and resilience of the system changed?\n\n::: {.cell .markdown}\n### Problem 3 (10 points)\n\n**This problem is only required for students in BEE 5750**.\n\nConsider the lake eutrophication example from [Lecture 04](https://viveks.me/environmental-systems-analysis/slides/lecture03-1-eutrophication-modeling.html#/title-slide). Suppose that phosphorous is also atmospherically deposited onto the lake surface at a rate of $1.6 \\times 10^{-4} \\mathrm{kg/(yr} \\cdot \\mathrm{m}^2)$, which is then instantly mixed into the lake. Derive a model for the lake phosphorous concentration and find the maximum allowable point source phosphorous loading if the goal is to keep lake concentrations below 0.02 mg/L.\n\n:::\n\n::: {.cell .markdown}\n## References\n\nList any external references consulted, including classmates.\n:::\n\n",
