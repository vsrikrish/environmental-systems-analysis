# Review and Questions

## Mathematical Models

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width=50%}

A mathematical model of a system is a set of equations which maps inputs (*forcings*, *decisions*) to outputs (*outcomes*, *metrics*).

# Wastewater Modeling Example

## Wastewater Treatment Example

![Diagram of CRUD release from two factories](images/river_diagram.png)

Two factories are discharging a chemical, *chlororadiated ureadicarboxyl* (CRUD), into the Riley River. 

## Wastewater Treatment Example

![Diagram of CRUD release from two factories](images/river_diagram.png)

Environmental authorities have sampled water from the river and CRUD concentrations exceed the legal standard (1 mg/L). 

## Wastewater Treatment Example

![Diagram of CRUD release from two factories](images/river_diagram.png)

We want to design a CRUD removal plan to get back in compliance.

## Wastewater Treatment Example

- **Where do we start?**
- **What do we need to know?**

## CRUD Decay Rate

CRUD decays in the river with first-order decay coefficient $k=0.45 \ \text{d}^{-1}$.

## How Much To Remove?

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width=40%}
Consider the problem at each point of release.

1. What is the inflow? What is the outflow for a given $E_i$?
2. How does this impact the concentration downstream?

::: {.column width=60%}
![](images/crud-baseline.svg)

$$\begin{align*}
\text{(recall that } 1 \ \text{mg/L} &= 1 \ \text{g/m}^3 \\
 &= 10^{-3} \ \text{kg/m}^3\text{)}
 \end{align*}$$

## Mass-Balance at Release 1

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width=40%}
Factory 1 releases $1000 \ \text{kg/d}$ without treatment.

**What is the outflow for a given treatment fraction $E_1$?**

## Mass-Balance at Release 1

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width=40%}
Factory 1 releases $1000 \ \text{kg/d}$ without treatment.

Total CRUD after factory 1 release: $\color{blue}100 + \color{red} 1000(1-E_1) \color{black} \ \text{kg/d}$

## Mass-Balance at Release 2

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width=40%}
Is this the inflow at Release 2?

## CRUD First-Order Mass Decay

Given first-order decay rate of $0.45 \ \text{d}^{-1}$:
$$\frac{dM}{dt} = -0.45 M \Rightarrow \frac{dM}{M} = -0.45 dt$$

::: {.fragment .fade-in}
$$\int_{M(0)}^{M(T)} \frac{dM}{M} = -0.45 \int_0^T dt$$
:::

::: {.fragment .fade-in}
$$\ln\left(\frac{M(T)}{M(0)}\right) = -0.45 T$$
:::

## First-Order Mass Decay

So, after $t$ days:
$$M(t) = M(0) \exp\left(-0.45 t\right)$$

::: {.fragment .fade-in}
**Is this what we need?**
:::

::: {.fragment .fade-in}
No! We need $M(x)$, where $x$ is some distance downstream.
:::

## Decay in Terms of Distance

Since the velocity of the river is $25 \ \text{km/d}$:

$$M(x) = M_0 \exp\left(-\frac{0.45 x}{25}\right), \quad x \leq 10 \ \text{km}.$$

::: {.fragment .fade-in}
Simplifying and plugging in $x = 10$ and $M_0$, the inflow of CRUD at the factory 2 release is:

$$M(10) = (1100 - 1000E_1) \exp(-0.18) \ \text{kg/d}.$$
:::

## Mass-Balance at Release 2

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width=40%}
This means that after factory 2 releases CRUD, the mass is:

$$\color{red}(1100 - 1000E_1) \exp(-0.18) \color{black}+ \color{blue}1200(1 - E_2) \ \color{black}\text{kg/d}.$$
:::
::: {.column width=60%}

:::
::::

## CRUD Mass Downstream

We can use this as an initial condition for $M(x), x > 10$:

$$M(x) = M_1 \exp\left(-\frac{0.45x}{25}\right), \quad x > 10,$$
where $$M_1 = (1100 - 1000E_1) \exp(-0.18) + 1200(1 - E_2).$$

## CRUD Concentration Downstream

Therefore the concentration of CRUD $C(x)$ (in $\text{mg/L}$) at any point $x \ \text{km}$ downstream of the first release is:

$$
C(x) = \begin{cases}
M_0\exp\left(-0.45 x/25\right)  / 600,  & x \leq 10 \ \text{km} \\
M_1 \exp\left(-0.45x/25\right) / 660, & x > 10 \ \text{km} \\
\end{cases} 
$$
where
$$
\begin{align*}
M_0 &= 1100 - 1000E_1,\\
M_1 &= (1100 - 1000E_1) \exp(-0.18) + 1200(1 - E_2).
\end{align*}
$$

## What Does This Mean?

Looking at these equations:

The downstream concentration (past Release 2) depends on both $E_1$ and $E_2$.

::: {.fragment .fade-in}
**This means whether the regulatory limit is achieved depends on both factories!** 

We don't know what needed levels of $E_2$ are without knowing $E_1$.
:::

## Systems Management Requires the Full Picture

One option: We could leave $E_1$ up to the owners of Factory 1 and require $E_2$ be set based on this level.

::: {.incremental}
- **Is this fair?** 
- **What other information would we need to make this decision?**
:::

# Key Takeaways

## Key Takeaways

- Systems models can combine different types of processes (*e.g.* mass balance and reactions).
- Outcomes in one part of a system depend on others.
- Often need to consider decisions in different parts of the system together.
- Key questions about fairness with multiple outcomes or decisions.
