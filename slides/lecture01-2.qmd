# Why Study Systems?

## What Is A System?

A system is:

::: {.quote}
> "an interconnected set of elements that is coherently organized in a way that achieves something...
>
> A system must consist of three kinds of things: *elements*, *interconnections* and *a function or purpose*."

::: {.cite} 
--- Donella Meadows, *Thinking in Systems: A Primer*, 2008

## Examples of Systems

Can we think of any examples of systems?

. . .

What about things that are not systems?

## Why Are Systems Interesting?

In other words, **a system involves an interconnected set of components**.

Those interconnections can lead to very different dynamics and outcomes than if the component processes were studied in isolation.

This is called *emergence*.

# Key Definitions

## System State

**System State**: quantities or variables which evolve over time based on external inputs and system dynamics.

The state gives you a "snapshot" of the system at a given point in time.

## Stocks and Flows

- A **stock** is the amount of a system property: concentrations of a pollutant, numbers of currency units, etc.
- A **flow** is the way in which a stock changes: decay, diffusion, production, consumption, etc.

## Modeling Flows

For example:

::: {.incremental}
- Mass balance equations let us track changes in stocks at particular points;
- Equilibrium conditions are requirements that there is no net flow, and thus that stocks are preserved;
- Fate and transport modeling involves quantifying how stocks change as they move through the system.

# Examples of Systems Dynamics

## Feedback Loops

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width=60%}
One example of an emergent systems dynamic is a **reinforcing (positive) feedback loop**, where a shock to the system state gets worse.

Feedback loops can also be **dampening (negative)**, where a shock is weakened.

## Tipping Points

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width=50%}
Another important systems concept is a **tipping point**, where the system changes states abruptly and drastically.

Examples include lake eutrophication and ice-sheet melting.

## What Do We Need To Define A System?

::: {.incremental}
- **Components**: relevant processes, agents, etc
- **Interconnections**: relationships between system components
- **Control volume**: internal vs. external components
- **Inputs**: control policies and/or external forcings
- **Outputs**: measured quantities of interest

# Upcoming Schedule

## Next Classes

**Friday**: Work on Lab 1. 

- Preparation: 
    - Follow the steps in [Tools Setup]({{< var course.url >}}/setup.qmd) to get GitHub and Julia set up.
    - Click the Lab 1 link in Ed Discussion to link your GitHub account to the class roster and create your Lab 1 repository.

**Monday**: Overview of Systems Dynamics (aka the "Systems Zoo")
