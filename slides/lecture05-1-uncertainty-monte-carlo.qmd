# Review of Last Classes

## Simulation

- "Mimic" data generation given a certain model for the relevant processes;
- Often requires some type of discretization (not always!)

## Simulation Workflow

![Simulation Workflow](figures/simulation_workflow.svg){width=90%}

## Simulation

- "Mimic" data generation given a certain model for the relevant processes;
- Often requires some type of discretization (not always!)
- More complex approaches (*e.g.* discrete-event simulation) for specific use cases.

## What We Haven't Discussed

- **Calibration**: How do we select parameter values?
- **Validation**: Does the model adequately reproduce the system dynamics?


## Dissolved Oxygen

- Dissolved oxygen (DO) is essential for water quality and aquatic life.
- Commonly regulated to keep DO above a minimum threshold.
- DO impacted by a number of factors, notably organic waste decomposition and nitrification.
- "Sag Curve": DO reduced near a discharge until waste decomposition reduces OD and re-aeration can occur.

# Uncertainty and Systems Analysis

## Systems and Uncertainty

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width=50%}
- *Deterministic models*: uncertainty due to the separation between the "internals" of the system and the "external" environment.
- *Stochastic models*: additional uncertainty from internal stochasticity
:::

::: {.column width=50%}
![Conceptual Schematic of a Systems Model](figures/system-conceptual.svg)
:::
::::

## What is Uncertainty?

::: {.fragment .fade-in}
**Glib Answer**: *A lack of certainty!*
:::

::: {.fragment .fade-in}
**More Seriously**: Uncertainty refers to an inability to exactly describe current or future values or states.
:::

## Types of Uncertainty

Two (broad) types of uncertainties:

- **Aleatory** uncertainty, or uncertainties resulting from randomness;
- **Epistemic** uncertainty, or uncertainties resulting from lack of knowledge. 


# Risk

## Systems and Risk

Designing and managing environmental systems is often about **minimizing or managing risk**:

- Maintaining clean air/water;
- Power grid reliabiliy standards;
- Flooding/other hazards;
- Climate change mitigation/adaptation.

## What is Risk?

The [*Society for Risk Analysis* definition](https://www.sra.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/SRA-Glossary-FINAL.pdf): 

::: {.quote}

> "risk" involves uncertainty about the effects/implications of an activity with respect to something that humans value (such as health, well-being, wealth, property or the environment), often focusing on negative, undesirable consequences.

:::

## So What is Risk?

**Important**: "Risk" is not just another words for probability, but:

- Involves uncertainty;
- Undesireable outcomes;
- Effects matter, not just the events themselves.

## Components of Risk

::: {.columns}
::: {.column width=50%}
Multiple components which contribute to risk:

- Probability of a **hazard**;
- **Exposure** to that hazard;
- **Vulnerability** to outcomes;
- Socioeconomic **responses**.

## Systems and Risk Management

Risk management is often a key consideration in systems analysis. For example, consider regulatory standards.

- Often a tradeoff between strictness of a regulation and costs of compliance.
- Systems modeling is a key way to understand 
    - the impacts of changing a regulation
    - the probability of failure to meet standards.
  
# Probability

## Two Definitions of Probability

We often represent uncertainties with *probabilities*. What is a probability?

1. Long-run frequency of an event (**frequentist**)
2. Degree of belief that a proposition is true (**Bayesian**)

## Conditional Probabilities

We often don't want to just know if a particular event $A$ has a certain probability, but also how other events (call them $B$) might depend on that outcome.

**In other words:**

We want the *conditional probability* of $B$ given $A$, denoted $\mathbb{P}(B|A)$.

## Conditional Probabilities

We can write conditional probabilities in terms of unconditional probabilities:

$$\mathbb{P}(B|A) = \frac{\mathbb{P}(BA)}{\mathbb{P}(A)}.$$

## Bayes' Theorem

Conditional probabilities can be inverted according to **Bayes' Theorem**:

$$\mathbb{P}(A|B) = \frac{\mathbb{P}(B|A) \times \mathbb{P}(A)}{\mathbb{B}}.$$

## Probability Distributions

The probability of possible values of an unknown quantity are often represented as a probability distribution.

Probability distributions associate a probability to every event under consideration (the *event space*) and have to follow certain rules (for example, total probability = 1).

## Selecting a Distribution

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width=35%}
The specification of distributions can *strongly* influence the analysis. 
:::
::: {.column width=65%}
![Probabilistic interactions between sea-levels and exposure](figures/Risk_Interactions.jpg){width=90%}
:::
::::

## Selecting a Distribution

A distribution implicitly answers questions like:

- What is the most probable event? How much more likely is it than the others?
- Are larger or smaller events more, less, or equally probable?
- How probable are extreme events?
- Are different events correlated, or are they independent?

## Key Features of Probability Distributions

- Mean/Mode (what events are "typical")
- Skew (are larger or smaller events more or equally probable)
- Variance (how spread out is the distribution around the mode)
- Tail Probabilities (how probable are extreme events)

## Common Distributions

- Gaussian / Normal
- Lognormal
- Binomial
- Uniform / Discrete Uniform

## Probability Distribution Tails

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width=50%}
The tails of distributions represent the probability of high-impact outcomes.

**Key consideration**: Small changes to these (low) probabilities can greatly influence risk.

# Monte Carlo

## Stochastic Simulation

**Monte Carlo simulation**: Propagating random samples through a model to estimate a value (usually an expectation or a quantile).

        rankdir=LR

    b [label = "Random\n Samples"]

    d [label="Outputs"]

    a -> b [
        label="Sample"
    ]
    b -> c [
        label="Input"
    ]
    c -> d [
        label="Simulate"
    ]
}

```

## Goals of Monte Carlo

Monte Carlo is a broad method, which can be used to:

1. Obtain probability distributions of outputs;
2. Estimate deterministic quantities (***Monte Carlo estimation***).

## Monte Carlo Estimation

Monte Carlo estimation involves framing the quantity of interest as a summary statistic (such as an expected value).

## MC Example: Finding $\pi$

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width=50%}
::: {.fragment .fade-in}
Finding $\pi$ by sampling random values from the unit square and computing the fraction in the unit circle. This is an example of **Monte Carlo integration**.

::: {.fragment .fade-in}
$$\frac{\text{Area of Circle}}{\text{Area of Square}} = \frac{\pi}{4}$$

## Monte Carlo Estimation

This type of estimation can be repeated with any simulation model that has a stochastic component.

For example, consider our dissolved oxygen model. Suppose that we have a probability distribution for the inflow DO.

**How could we compute the probability of DO falling below the regulatory standard somewhere downstream?**

## Monte Carlo and Uncertainty Propagation

1. Draw samples from some distribution;
2. Eun them through one or more models;
3. Compute the (conditional) probability of outcomes of interest (for good or bad).


# Key Takeaways

## Key Takeaways

- Systems analysis features many uncertainties, which may be neglected with certain methods/model setups.
- Choice of probability distribution can have large impacts on uncertainty and risk estimates: **try not to use distributions just because they're convenient.**
- **Monte Carlo**: Estimate expected values of outcomes using simulation.
