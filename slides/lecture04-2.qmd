# Uncertainty and Systems Analysis

## Systems and Uncertainty

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width=50%}
Deterministic systems models can be subject to uncertainties due to the separation between the "internals" of the system and the "external" environment.
:::

::: {.column width=50%}
![Conceptual Schematic of a Systems Model](images/system-conceptual.svg)

## Reminder: "All Models Are Wrong, But Some Are Useful"

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width=50%}
*Every* systems model simplifies or neglects certain aspects of the system!

Even if appropriate, this results in uncertainty about how results translate to the real system.

## What is Uncertainty?

**Glib Answer**: *A lack of certainty!*

::: {.fragment .fade-in}
**More Seriously**: Uncertainty refers to an inability to exactly describe current or future values or states.
:::

## Types of Uncertainty

Two (broad) types of uncertainties:

- **Aleatory** uncertainty, or uncertainties resulting from randomness;
- **Epistemic** uncertainty, or uncertainties resulting from lack of knowledge. 


## Probability

We often represent uncertainty using *probabilities*.

What is probability?

## What Is Probability?

{{< include _poll-prompt.qmd >}}

## Two Definitions of Probability

1. Long-run frequency of an event (**frequentist**)
2. Degree of belief that a proposition is true (**Bayesian**)

The frequentist definition concerns what would happen with a large enough number of repeated trials. 

The Bayesian definition concerns the odds that you should bet on an outcome. 

## Probability Distributions

We often represent probability using distributions --- more on this next time.

The choice of distributions can often play a large role in outcomes.

## Neglecting Correlations

For example, an often key concern is whether uncertainties are **correlated**: do certain outcomes tend to occur in combination?

If this is the case, it can bias results to assume independence.

## Climate Change

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width=40%}
Let's look at how global mean temperatures have changed from 1850--2022 relative to a preindustrial baseline.
:::
::: {.column width=60%}
```{julia}
# Data from https://crudata.uea.ac.uk/cru/data/temperature/
# The CSV is read into a DataFrame object, and we specify that it is comma delimited
temp_data = CSV.read("data/climate/HadCRUT.5.0.1.0.analysis.summary_series.global.annual.csv", DataFrame, delim=",")

# The syntax df[!, "colname"] selects the entire column named "colname" but does not make and return a copy
# To get a copy (for example, if you want to modify that vector but not the original dataframe), use df[:, "column"]
# If we wanted to only select a range of rows, use df[row_index, "colname"], where row_index could be a single value, a numerical or Boolean array
time_obs = temp_data[!, "Time"] # years
temp_obs = temp_data[!, "Anomaly (deg C)"] # GMT estimate
temp_obs_lo = temp_data[!, "Lower confidence limit (2.5%)"] # 2.5% confidence level
temp_obs_hi = temp_data[!, "Upper confidence limit (97.5%)"] # 97.5% confidence level

temp_baseline = mean(temp_obs[1:51]) # get 1850-1900 baseline for renormalization
temp_obs = temp_obs .- temp_baseline
temp_obs_lo = temp_obs_lo .- temp_baseline
temp_obs_hi = temp_obs_hi .- temp_baseline

# The ribbon=(...) argument plots a ribbon around the main y-axis value and can be passed as a single array (for a symmetric error bound or a tuple of arrays (for lower/upper bounds, as below))
plot(time_obs, temp_obs, ribbon=(temp_obs - temp_obs_lo, temp_obs_hi - temp_obs), color="blue", linewidth=3, fillalpha=0.2, legend=false, xlabel="Year", ylabel="Temperature anomaly (°C)", tickfontsize=14, guidefontsize=14)
plot!(size=(750, 500))

## Causes of Climate Changes

Climatic changes result from changes to the heat or energy balance of the Earth due to alterations to the chemical composition of the atmosphere, which include: 

- greenhouse gas emissions;
- aerosol emissions from air pollution or volcanic eruptions;
- changes to the solar cycle.

## Radiative Forcing

The impact of these changes on the energy balance of the planet are referred to as *radiative forcing*. 

A positive radiative forcing means a warming effect (net heat increase) and a negative radiative forcing means a cooling effect (net heat loss).

## Projections of Future Radiative Forcing

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width=40%}
Let's look at the projected forcings from one of the official scenarios (*actually the most extreme scenario*) used to assess future climate change. 

:::
::: {.column width=60%}
```{julia}
# Dataset from https://zenodo.org/record/3973015
# The CSV is read into a DataFrame object, and we specify that it is comma delimited
forcings_all = CSV.read("data/climate/ERF_ssp585_1750-2500.csv", DataFrame, delim=",")

# Separate out the individual components
forcing_co2 = forcings_all[!,"co2"]
# Get total aerosol forcings
forcing_aerosol_rad = forcings_all[!,"aerosol-radiation_interactions"]
forcing_aerosol_cloud = forcings_all[!,"aerosol-cloud_interactions"]
forcing_aerosol = forcing_aerosol_rad + forcing_aerosol_cloud
forcing_total = forcings_all[!,"total"]
forcing_non_aerosol = forcing_total - forcing_aerosol
forcing_other = forcing_total - (forcing_co2 + forcing_aerosol)

t = time_forcing = Int64.(forcings_all[!,"year"]) # Ensure that years are interpreted as integers

plot(xlabel="Year", ylabel="Radiative Forcing (W/m²)", tickfontsize=14, guidefontsize=14, legendfontsize=14)
plot!(time_forcing, forcing_total, label="Total", color=:black, linewidth=4)
plot!(time_forcing, forcing_co2, label="CO₂", color=:orange, linewidth=3)
plot!(time_forcing, forcing_aerosol, label="Aerosol", color=:blue, linewidth=3)
plot!(time_forcing, forcing_other, label="Other", color=:purple, linewidth=3)
vline!([2014], label="", color=:red, linestyle=:dash)

## What Is Uncertain?

There are many uncertainties in modeling climate changes:

1. How much CO~2~ gets absorbed by sinks/emitted by sources?
2. How strong is the aerosol cooling effect?
3. How rapidly is heat absorbed by and transported into the deep ocean?
4. What is the atmospheric temperature response to increases in radiative forcing?

## Correlated Climate Uncertainties

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width=50%}

- Equilibrium Climate Sensitivity

- Aerosol Cooling Factor
- Carbon Sink Respiration Sensitivity

# Risk

## Systems and Risk

Designing and managing environmental systems is often about **minimizing or managing risk**:

- Maintaining clean air/water;
- Power grid reliabiliy standards;
- Flooding/other hazards;
- Climate change mitigation/adaptation.

## What is Risk?

The [*Society for Risk Analysis* definition](https://www.sra.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/SRA-Glossary-FINAL.pdf): 

::: {.quote}

> "risk" involves uncertainty about the effects/implications of an activity with respect to something that humans value (such as health, well-being, wealth, property or the environment), often focusing on negative, undesirable consequences.

:::

## IPCC Definition of Risk

::: {.quote}

> ...the potential for consequences where something of value is at stake and where the outcome is uncertain, recognizing the diversity of values. Risk is often represented as probability of occurrence of hazardous events or trends multiplied by the impacts if these events or trends occur.

::: {.cite}
--- [Oppenheimer et al (2014)](https://www.ipcc.ch/site/assets/uploads/2018/02/WGIIAR5-Chap19_FINAL.pdf)

## So What is Risk?

**Important**: "Risk" is not just another words for probability, but:

- Involves uncertainty;
- Undesireable outcomes;
- Effects matter, not just the events themselves.

## Components of Risk

::: {.columns}
::: {.column width=50%}
Multiple components which contribute to risk:

- Probability of a **hazard**;
- **Exposure** to that hazard;
- **Vulnerability** to outcomes;
- Socioeconomic **responses**.

## Risk Management Example: Well Contamination

Consider the potential contamination of well water. How could we mitigate risk by:

::: {.incremental}
- reducing **hazards**:
- reducing **exposure**:
- reducing **vulnerability**:
- influencing **responses**:
:::

## Systems and Risk Management

Risk management is often a key consideration in systems analysis. For example, consider regulatory standards.

- Often a tradeoff between strictness of a regulation and costs of compliance.
- Systems modeling is a key way to understand 
    - the impacts of changing a regulation
    - the probability of failure to meet standards.

# Key Points

## Key Points

- Uncertainties are a fundamental part of systems modeling and analysis.
- Need to be thoughtful about the choices that were made in modeling and how they impact outcomes.
- Probabilities: more on this next class, but be careful about distributions and correlations!
- Systems analysis also often about understanding/managing risk.
