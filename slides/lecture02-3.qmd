# Review and Question

## Last Class

- Used mass-balances and reaction decay to formulate model for wastewater concentrations downstream of multiple releases.
- **Key Point**: Systems management requires accounting for the full dynamics, not (usually) one process/decision at a time.

# Lake Eutrophication Example

## What is Eutrophication?

**Eutrophication**: common environmental problem in which plants and algae feed on excess nutrients and become overabundant. 

## Lake Eutrophication Causes

In lakes, eutrophication is often caused by excess input of nutrients (particularly N and P). Excess N and P can come from: 

- point sources (such as industrial/sewage processes); and/or 
- non-point sources (such as agricultural runoff).

Excess nutrients are stored in sediment and recycled back into the lake, as well as transported by organisms/consumers.


## Effects of Lake Eutrophication

- **hypoxia** (reduction in oxygen from the decomposition of organic matter), leading to "dead zones";
- **acidification**(from the CO<sub>2</sub> produced by decomposition);
- **reduced sunlight** (from an accumulation of surface algae);
- **clogged water intakes**; and
- **reduction in recreational value and drinking water quality**.

## Management of Eutrophication

Once a lake is eutrophied, it can be difficult to restore to *oligotrophic* state:

- Reduce N and P going forward to reduce pressure;
- Remove and treat sediment/water;
- Biofiltration.

Restoration takes a long time and is not guaranteed!

- Model introduced by [Carpenter et al (1999)](http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/2641327).

## Shallow Lake Model: Variables

| Variable | Meaning | Units |
|:--------:|:--------|:-----|
| $X_t$ | P level in lake at time $t$ | dimensionless |
| $a_t$ | Controllable (point-source) P release | dimensionless |
| $y_t$ | Random (non-point-source) P runoff | dimensionless |

## Shallow Lake Model: Runoff

- Random runoffs $y_t$ are sampled from a LogNormal distribution.

```{julia}
#| echo: false
#| label: fig-lognorm
#| fig-cap: "Lognormal Distributions"
#| fig-alt: "Lognormal Distributions"
#| fig-align: center

plot(LogNormal(0.25, 1), linewidth=3, label="LogNormal(0.25, 1)", guidefontsize=16, legendfontsize=14, tickfontsize=16)
plot!(LogNormal(0.5, 1), linewidth=3, label="LogNormal(0.5, 2)")
plot!(LogNormal(0.25, 2), linewidth=3, label="LogNormal(0.25, 2)")
plot!(size=(1000, 400), grid=:false, left_margin=10mm, right_margin=10mm, bottom_margin=10mm)
xlims!((0, 6))
ylabel!("Density")
xlabel!(L"y_t")
```

## Shallow Lake Model: P Dynamics

- Lake loses P at a linear rate, $bX_t$.
- Nutrient cycling reintroduces P from sediment: $$\frac{X_t^q}{1 + X_t^q}.$$

## Shallow Lake Model

So the P level (state) $X_{t+1}$ is given by:
$$\begin{gather*}
X_{t+1} = X_t + a_t + y_t + \frac{X_t^q}{1 + X_t^q} - bX_t, \\
y_t \underset{\underset{\Large\text{\color{red}sample}}{\color{red}\uparrow}}{\sim} \text{LogNormal}(\mu, \sigma^2).
\end{gather*}
$$

# Shallow Lake Model Dynamics

## Dynamics Without Inflows

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width=50%}
First, let's look at the dynamics without inflows ($a_t=y_t=0$) to get a sense of baseline behavior.

We'll focus on the case where $q = 2.5$.

**Important**: where is the black line (recycled P from sediment) relative to the straight line (outflows)?

This reflects trend in natural P dynamics (red arrows).

## Dynamics Without Inflows: Equilibria

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width=50%}
The intersection points are **equilibria**, where the state of the system is fixed and doesn't change.

## Dynamics Without Inflows: Equilibria

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width=50%}
For $b=0.4$, three equilibria:

1. $X=0$;
2. $X = X_o = 0.67$ (*oligotrophic*)
3. $X = X_e = 2.2$ (*eutrophic*)

## Dynamics Without Inflows: Equilibria

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width=50%}
These equilibria have different nearby behaviors:

- $X=0$ and $X=2.2$ are **stable**: the state will recover after a perturbation.
- $X=0.67$ is **unstable**.

This gives rise to a **tipping point** as we cross $X=0.67$: stable oligotrophic behavior suddenly switches to eutrophication.

## Dynamics Without Inflows: Bifurcation

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width=50%}
For different values of $b$, the number of equilibria changes.

- $b = 0.2$: Only two equilibria
    - stable at $X=0$
    - unstable at $X=0.36$
- $b=0.6$: Only stable equilibrium at $X=0$.

{{< embed notebooks/shallow-lake.ipynb#fig-lake-noinput-eq >}}
:::

## Dynamics Without Inflows: Bifurcation

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width=50%}
These changes in the type and/or number of equilibria is called a **bifurcation**, and these are relatively common properties of systems.
:::

:::

## Dynamics Without Inflows: Bifurcation

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width=50%}
Bifurcations are important, because they can result in unexpected outcomes if we plan for one type of stability but get another.

This is particularly acute when we are uncertain about the values of relevant parameters.

## Dynamics With Inflows

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width=50%}
Let's look at what happens if $a_t + y_t = 0.05$ (constant inflows). The equilibria are shifted.

With $b=0.2$, this eliminates equilibria: the lake will inevitably eutrophy.

## Dynamics With Inflows

But this assumes constant inflows: remember that we would treat $y_t$ as random.

What are the implications for management?

# Key Takeaways

## Key Takeaways

- Nonlinear system dynamics (*e.g.* bifurcations, but also feedbacks) can complicate management.
- Important to bear these in mind: many methods we will see involve finding a solution under assumptions about parameters.
- What do we do about random external forcings? Will talk about later...
