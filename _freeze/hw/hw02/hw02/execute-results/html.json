You will also be asked to identify a minimum distance for the addition of a third discharge stream.\n\n### Load Environment\n\nThe following code loads the environment and makes sure all needed packages are installed. This should be at the start of most Julia scripts.\n\n::: {#1b219345 .cell execution_count=1}\n``` {.julia .cell-code}\nimport Pkg\nPkg.activate(@__DIR__)\nPkg.instantiate()\n```\n:::\n\n\n::: {#fe0c2409 .cell execution_count=2}\n``` {.julia .cell-code}\nusing Plots\nusing LaTeXStrings\nusing Distributions\n```\n:::\n\n\n## Problems (Total: 40 Points)\n\n\nA river which flows at 6 km/d is receiving waste discharges from two sources which are 15 km apart, as shown in @fig-river. The oxygen reaeration rate is 0.55 day^-1^, and the decay rates of CBOD and NBOD are are 0.55 and 0.25 day^-1^, respectively. The river's saturated dissolved oxygen concentration is 10m g/L.\n\n![Schematic of the system](figures/river_diagram.png){#fig-river}\n\n\n::: {.cell .markdown}\n\n### Problem 1 (8 points)\n\nIf the characteristics of the river inflow and waste discharges are given in @tbl-river, write a Julia model to compute the dissolved oxygen concentration from the first wastewater discharge to an arbitrary distance `d` km downstream. Use your model to compute the maximum dissolved oxygen concentration up to 50km downstream and how far downriver this maximum occurs.\n\n| Parameter | River Inflow | Waste Stream 1 | Waste Stream 2 |\n|:---------:|-------------:|---------------:|---------------:|\n| Inflow | 100,000 m^3^/d | 10,000 m^3^/d | 15,000 m^3^/d |\n| DO Concentration | 7.5 mg/L | 5 mg/L | 5 mg/L |\n| CBOD | 5 mg/L | 50 mg/L | 45 mg/L |\n| NBOD | 5 mg/L | 35 mg/L | 35 mg/L |\n: River inflow and waste stream characteristics for Problem 1. {#tbl-river}\n\n:::\n\n::: {.eall .markdown}\n### Problem 2 (4 points)\n\nUse your model to plot the dissolved oxygen concentration in the river from the first waste stream to 50km downstream. What do you notice?\n\n:::\n\n::: {.cell .markdown}\n### Problem 3 (3 points)\n\nUnder the assumptions of Problem 1, determine the distance from waste stream 2 it will take for the dissolved oxygen concentration of the river to recover to 6 mg/L.\n:::\n\n::: {.cell .markdown}\n### Problem 4 (5 points)\n\nWhat is the minimum level of treatment (% removal of organic waste) for waste stream 2 that will ensure that the dissolved oxygen concentration never drops below 4 mg/L, assuming that waste stream 1 remains untreated?\n:::\n\n::: {.cell .markdown}\n### Problem 5 (5 points)\n\nIf both waste streams are treated equally, what is the minimum level of treatment (% removal of organic waste) for the two sources required to ensure that the dissolved oxygen concentration never drops below 4 mg/L?\n\n:::\n\n::: {.cell .markdown}\n\n### Problem 6 (5 points)\n\nSuppose you are responsible for designing a waste treatment plan for discharges into the river, with a regulatory mandate to keep the dissolved oxygen concentration above 4 mg/L. Discuss whether you'd opt to treat waste stream 2 alone or both waste streams equally. What other information might you need to make a conclusion, if any?\n\n:::\n\n::: {.cell .markdown}\n\n### Problem 7 (5 points)\n\nSuppose that it is known that the DO concentrations at the river inflow can vary uniformly between 6 mg/L and 8 mg/L. How often will the treatment plan identified in Problem 5 (both waste streams treated equally) fail to comply with the regulatory standard?\n\n:::\n\n::: {.cell .markdown}\n\n### Problem 8 (5 points)\n\nA factory is planning a third wastewater discharge into the river downstream of the second plant. This discharge would consist of 5 m^3^/day of wastewater with a dissolved oxygen content of 4.5 mg/L and CBOD and NBOD levels of 50 and 45 mg/L, respectively.\n\nAssume that the treatment plan you identified in Problem 5 is still in place for the existing discharges. If the third discharge will not be treated, under the original inflow conditions (7.5 mg/L DO), how far downstream from the second discharge does this third discharge need to be placed to keep the river concentration from dropping below 4 mg/L?\n:::\n\n\n::: {.cell .markdown}\n## References\n\nList any external references consulted, including classmates.\n:::\n\n",
