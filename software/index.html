Install Julia using the downloaded file.</p> <p>After installing, make sure that you can run Julia. You may have a &quot;Julia 1.7&quot; program on your computer, or you can run the command <code>julia</code> in a command line. Either way, you should see a window &#40;or terminal&#41; like the following:</p> <p><img src="/environmental-systems-analysis/assets/images/julia-terminal.png" alt="Image of Julia Terminal" /> This is called the <a href="https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/stdlib/REPL/"><strong>Julia REPL</strong></a>, which is the primary environment for interactively executing Julia commands. Make sure that you can execute <code>1&#43;1</code>.</p> <h3 id=package_management ><a href="#package_management" class=header-anchor >Package Management</a></h3> <h4 id=introduction_to_pkg ><a href="#introduction_to_pkg" class=header-anchor >Introduction to <code>Pkg</code></a></h4> <p>The next step is to become familiar with Julia&#39;s package manager, <a href="https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/stdlib/Pkg/"><code>Pkg</code></a>. We will use <code>Pkg</code> to install packages which can then be loaded and used in the REPL or in Julia code. There are two ways to load <code>Pkg</code>:</p> <ol> <li><p>From the <code>julia&gt;</code> REPL prompt, enter <code>&#93;</code> to switch from <em>Julia mode</em> to <em>Pkg mode</em>:</p> </ol> <p><img src="/environmental-systems-analysis/assets/images/julia-pkg.png" alt="Julia REPL in Pkg Mode" /></p> <ol start=2 > <li><p>In a script, use <code>import Pkg</code> &#40;typically at the start of your file&#41;.</p> </ol> <p>With <code>Pkg</code>, packages are managed within <em>environments</em>, which are independent sets of packages associated with a location or a project, like other package managers such as <code>conda</code> or <code>virtualenv</code>. When packages are added or updated, Julia will only update dependencies within a given environment, so different versions of packages can be used for different projects. Unlike <code>conda</code>, which keeps separate installations for each environment, each version of each package is installed in a single location &#40;which can then be accessed by multiple environments&#41;, which reduces storage space use.</p> <p>Each environment has two files which specify required packages: <code>Project.toml</code> and <code>Manifest.toml</code>. The combination of these two files allows for complete reproduction of the package environment. We will provide these files for any homework assignment or in-class exercise to ensure compatibility, but if you <a href="#adding-and-removing-packages">make changes</a>, you should commit and push them. If you upgrade your Julia version and run into a problem, you can delete <code>Manifest.toml</code> and <a href="#installing-needed-packages">re-create it</a>.</p> <p>The default environment is the &quot;central&quot; environment for your Julia version, which in this case is <code>v1.7</code> &#40;as reflected by the <code>&#40;@v1.7&#41; pkg&gt;</code> prompt in the screenshot above. This environment will be used any time you load Julia and start evaluating code without actively selecting a new environment. To create a new environment or load an existing one, use <code>activate &lt;environment directory&gt;</code>, where <code>&lt;environment directory&gt;</code> is the location of the relevant <code>Project.toml</code>. For example,</p> <pre><code class="julia hljs">(v1<span class=hljs-number >.7</span>) pkg&gt; activate .</code></pre>
<p>will activate an environment in the current working directory &#40;loading one if it exists or creating a new one if it does not&#41;. This will change the prompt to reflect the active environment. For example,</p>
<pre><code class="julia hljs">(v1<span class=hljs-number >.7</span>) pkg&gt; activate tutorial
(tutorial) pkg&gt;</code></pre>
<p>shows that the environment in the <code>tutorial/</code> directory has been activated.</p>
<p>The equivalent command for Julia code is <code>Pkg.activate&#40;&#41;</code>, so you might see the following at the top of a file:</p>
<pre><code class="julia hljs"><span class=hljs-keyword >import</span> Pkg
Pkg.activate(<span class=hljs-string >&quot;.&quot;</span>) <span class=hljs-comment ># activate an environment in the current working directory</span></code></pre>
<h4 id=adding_and_removing_packages ><a href="#adding_and_removing_packages" class=header-anchor >Adding and Removing Packages</a></h4>
<p>To add packages to an environment, use <code>add</code>:</p>
<pre><code class="julia hljs">(<span class=hljs-meta >@v1</span><span class=hljs-number >.7</span>) pkg&gt; activate tutorial
(tutorial) pkg&gt; add Plots</code></pre>
<p><code>Pkg</code> will then install and pre-compile any needed dependencies. Similarly, to remove packages, use <code>rm</code>.</p>
<h4 id=installing_needed_packages ><a href="#installing_needed_packages" class=header-anchor >Installing Needed Packages</a></h4>
<p>After using <code>Pkg.activate</code> to load an environment, you may want to make sure that the correct versions of each of the packages are installed &#40;based on the <code>Project.toml</code>&#41;. This is done using <code>Pkg.instantiate&#40;&#41;</code>:</p>
<pre><code class="julia hljs">(v1<span class=hljs-number >.7</span>) pkg&gt; activate tutorial
(tutorial) pkg&gt; instantiate</code></pre>
<p>or, at the start of a file,</p>
<pre><code class="julia hljs"><span class=hljs-keyword >import</span> Pkg
Pkg.activate(<span class=hljs-string >&quot;.&quot;</span>) <span class=hljs-comment ># activate an environment in the current working directory</span>
Pkg.instantiate() <span class=hljs-comment ># install any needed package versions</span></code></pre>
<p>If all listed package versions are installed, <code>Pkg.instantiate&#40;&#41;</code> will return nothing. If there is no <code>Manifest.toml</code> associated with the project directory &#40;if it was deleted or you only started with a <code>Project.toml</code>&#41;, it will be created using this step.</p>
<h4 id=loading_packages ><a href="#loading_packages" class=header-anchor >Loading Packages</a></h4>
<p>Once the environment has been activated, you can load and use any packages. The primary command is <code>using</code>, as in</p>
<pre><code class="julia hljs"><span class=hljs-keyword >using</span> Plots <span class=hljs-comment ># load Plots.jl for use</span></code></pre>
<p>You can also load multiple packages at once,</p>
<pre><code class="julia hljs"><span class=hljs-keyword >using</span> Plots, DataFrames</code></pre>
<p>though you may want to minimize this, as it can get unreadable quickly.</p>
<p>Good form is to load all relevant packages at the beginning of the file, but you can load packages as needed later if you only use those commands in a particular section of your code.</p>
<h3 id=using_weavejl ><a href="#using_weavejl" class=header-anchor >Using <code>Weave.jl</code></a></h3>
<p>Homework reports will be written using the <a href="https://weavejl.mpastell.com/stable/"><code>Weave.jl</code> package</a>, which allows the intermixing of Julia code and written text &#40;using Markdown&#41;. LaTeX commands can also be used to format mathematics. For more information on how to use <code>Weave.jl</code> for this class, see the documentation and <a href="/environmental-systems-analysis/assignments//workflow#assignment_report_writing">our instructions on assignment report writing</a></p>
<h2 id=github ><a href="#github" class=header-anchor >GitHub</a></h2>
<h3 id=what_are_git_and_github ><a href="#what_are_git_and_github" class=header-anchor >What are Git and GitHub?</a></h3>
<p>Git is an industry standard version control system. It allows you to keep track of changes to files. This means that you can document changes and bug fixes, revert changes that created problems, and create alternative pathways to test changes which can then be incorporated into the main file&#40;s&#41; if desired. GitHub is a commonly used remote repository which ties into git. Remote repositories allow version-controlled software to be backed up and shared.</p>
<h3 id=setup_an_account ><a href="#setup_an_account" class=header-anchor >Setup An Account</a></h3>
<p>If you don&#39;t have one, you should create an account at <a href="https://github.com">GitHub</a>, ideally linked to your Cornell email &#40;though if you have a pre-existing GitHub account, you can use it&#41;. It will be easiest if your username includes your name or NetID in some way, but it&#39;s not necessary. You should also install <a href="http://happygitwithr.com/install-git.html">git</a> if your computer does not have it &#40;which you can test by typing <code>git</code> at a command line&#41;.</p>
<p>You can interact with GitHub either through the command line &#40;using a terminal&#41; or <a href="https://desktop.github.com/">GitHub Desktop</a>.</p>
<p>Next, you should create a folder for the course, something like <code>bee-4750/</code>. You could create a <code>lectures/</code> subfolder in here for notes, but we&#39;re mostly interested in storing homework files.</p>
<h3 id=basic_terminology ><a href="#basic_terminology" class=header-anchor >Basic Terminology</a></h3>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Git</strong>: A software version control system. For an introduction to Git, see <a href="https://coderefinery.github.io/git-intro/">these CodeRefinery tutorials</a>.</p>

<li><p><strong>Repository</strong>: A database storing and tracking the files and folders associated with a particular project. A <em>local</em> repository is hosted on a specific, locally-accessed machine, while a <em>remote</em> repository is hosted and accessible on a server. Remote repositories can be <em>private</em> if they are accessible only by certain users or <em>public</em> if they can be seen and accessed by anyone.</p>

<li><p><strong>Commit</strong>: A commit consists of a tracked change to a file or a set of files. When you make a commit using <code>git commit</code>, Git creates a unique ID associated with the state of the files in the repository at that point. This allows you to track how files have changed and use or revert back to a previous state. As a result, it is a good idea to make frequent commits which respond to small code changes &#40;like adding a new feature or fixing a specific bug&#41;. Files are added to a commit using <code>git add &lt;files&gt;</code>, which can be used multiple times for a given commit. Commits are typically associated with a message briefly describing what changes were made, using <code>git commit -m &quot;&lt;commit-message&gt;&quot;</code></p>

<li><p><strong>GitHub</strong>: A cloud-based service for remote management and storage of git repositories.</p>

<li><p><strong>Clone</strong>: A clone is a copy of a remote repository on your local system. A clone allows you to make changes to the files in the local version of the repository and keep track of those changes using Git. These changes can later be &quot;pushed&quot; to the remote repository. You can clone a remote repository to which you have access using <code>git clone &lt;remote-repository-url&gt;</code>.</p>

<li><p><strong>Push</strong>: Changes to a local repository are sent to the remote repository using <code>git push</code>. Errors when pushing are usually the result of misalignments between the local and remote repository histories; a Google search can usually identify the specific cause.</p>

<li><p><strong>Pull</strong>: Pulling is the opposite of pushing; a <code>git pull</code> updates the local repository to reflect changes to the remote repository. To minimize the risk of push errors for simple projects &#40;where it&#39;s unlikely that too many people are making substantial changes&#41;, it&#39;s a good idea to pull before you start to make local changes.</p>

</ul>
<h3 id=viewing_a_remote_repository ><a href="#viewing_a_remote_repository" class=header-anchor >Viewing A Remote Repository</a></h3>
<p>When you open a repository URL in your browser, there are several tabs; the default tab is &quot;Code&quot;. That&#39;s the main tab you&#39;ll use, though you can use &quot;Issues&quot; to request code help from the instructional staff or &quot;Actions&quot; to see whether your report has successfully been compiled &#40;or if it&#39;s failed, why&#41;. The &quot;Code&quot; tab includes a link to the commit history of the repository, which will give you the unique IDs associated with previous commits if you want to roll back any changes.</p>
<p>An important button is the green &quot;Code&quot; button. Clicking on this will give you the URL to use when you clone the repository. </p>
<p><img src="/environmental-systems-analysis/assets/images/github-clone.png" alt="Results of clicking &quot;Code&quot; on GitHub" /></p>
<p>If you have SSH set up to work with GitHub &#40;which is not necessary here, but is generally a good idea for security&#39;s sake&#41;, you can use the SSH address; otherwise, use the HTTPS address.</p>
<p>Finally, in the &quot;Code&quot; tab is a view of the repository structure, including folders and files. You can click on those links to view the code without having to clone the entire repository.</p>
<p>The README for the repository &#40;generated from the repository&#39;s <code>README.md</code> file&#41; is also included. This will contain an overview of the assignment, a list of packages included in the provided environment, and instructions on how to compile your report &#40;which you may not need after the first couple of assignments&#41;.</p>
<h3 id=clone_your_repository ><a href="#clone_your_repository" class=header-anchor >Clone Your Repository</a></h3>
<p>The instructions in this section and below assume that you&#39;re interacting with Git and GitHub using your system&#39;s command line. If you use a tool with a graphical interface, please familiarize yourself with the specifics for that application.</p>
<p>To clone your repository, navigate to a parent directory where the local repositories for this class will live. For example, if you have a <code>classes/</code> directory for your schoolwork, you could create a BEE 4750 subdirectory from within this directory using <code>mkdir BEE4750</code>. Then navigate to this directory with <code>cd BEE4750</code>. You don&#39;t need to manually create a directory for each assignment; this will be automatically done when you clone the remote repository. The clone command will be something like</p>
<pre><code class="bash hljs">git <span class=hljs-built_in >clone</span> &lt;repository-clone-url&gt; &lt;local-folder-name&gt;</code></pre>
<p>The <code>local-folder-name</code> is an optional argument; if you leave it off, it will use the same name as the repository. This might be a bit clunky due to the naming conventions of GitHub Classroom, and you might want to simplify it to just be <code>hw0</code> or <code>hw1</code> or some such. This will then create local copies of all the folders and files in the repository within <code>local-folder-name/</code>, which you can then start editing. It will also automatically set up the remote repository as the default remote repository for the local repository, so no further configuration is needed.</p>
<h3 id=check_the_status_of_your_repository ><a href="#check_the_status_of_your_repository" class=header-anchor >Check the Status of Your Repository</a></h3>
<p><code>git status</code> is a useful command to use to see what files are different from the remote repository. It will also show you which files Git is not tracking, which you may or may not want to add to the repository. You can use <code>git ignore</code> to make <code>git status</code> ignore any files or classes of files that you would never like to track.</p>
<h3 id=commit_changes ><a href="#commit_changes" class=header-anchor >Commit Changes</a></h3>
<p>Once you have made some changes to your local repository, it&#39;s a good idea to make a commit so that the state of the repository is saved &#40;in case further changes break something&#41;. A good commit has a few characteristics. It should be small; each commit should correspond to a coherent change like the addition of a new &quot;feature&quot; or a bug fix. This makes it easy to go back to a previous state where things were known to work. When too many changes are made within a single commit, it may not be clear what worked or didn&#39;t work at that state or what might be lost by rolling back to a previous commit. It&#39;s a good idea, for example, to make a commit whenever you make a first attempt at solving a problem; you can then make subsequent commits as you make edits or fix bugs. Commits are associated with brief &quot;commit messages&quot; which describe the changes made in that commit; make these short but informative&#33;</p>
<p>If you have only changed a few files and want all of those changes added to the commit, you can use</p>
<pre><code class="bash hljs">git commit -am <span class=hljs-string >&quot;Commit Message&quot;</span></code></pre>
<p>Otherwise, if you want to select only specific files for a particular commit, you can break this into two commands:</p>
<pre><code class="bash hljs">git add &lt;files&gt;
git commit -m <span class=hljs-string >&quot;Commit Message&quot;</span></code></pre>
<p>where <code>git add</code> can be used as many times as needed to add all of the relevant files.</p>
<h3 id=pushing_commits ><a href="#pushing_commits" class=header-anchor >Pushing Commits</a></h3>
<p>After each commit &#40;or after a few commits&#41;, you should push your changes to the remote repository to keep things synced. You do this with a <code>git push</code> command. If this is successful, the remote repository view will be updated with the commits that you pushed and the new state of the repository.</p>
