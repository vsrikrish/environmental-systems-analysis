## Office Hours


  * Time TBD (watch for poll today)
  * 1x/week by Zoom (to start)
  * I *will* require mask wearing in my office –- it's not a big space!

name: website


template: policies






## Course Website


  * The website for this course is [https://viveks.me/environmental-systems-analysis](https://viveks.me/environmental-systems-analysis)
  * Includes course information, announcements, schedule, notes, demos, resources
  * **Make sure you check the site regularly!**


---


name: communications


template: policies






## Communications


  * Use [Ed Discussion](https://us.edstem.org) for discussions about class, homework assignments, readings, etc.
  * Try to use public Ed posts instead of email and private posts so others can benefit from questions.
  * But when privacy or urgency is essential, use whatever channel is appropriate.
  * *Announcements primarily through the course website and Ed Discussion*

## If You're Sick...


  * Please do not come to class if you're sick or contagious. Your recovery, and everyone else's health, are paramount.
  * We will make materials available on the website and GitHub, and will provide a Zoom link or recording if you need one.


---


template: policies






## Masks


  * Masks are not required, per university policy. However, please be respectful of the distancing requests from others if you are unmasked.
  * I will wear a mask unless everyone else in the classroom is masked. *This policy may change later in the semester based on how case counts are progressing, my travel schedule, etc.*

# Software Tools


<hr>


---


name: julia


template: software






## Julia


This course will use the [Julia programming language](https://julialang.org/).


  * Julia is a modern, powerful, fast language
  * Demos and tips available on the website
  * Familiarize yourself with the documentation and searching for answers to questions!
  * We will discuss and work on coding examples in class

***Programming language familiarity***


---


name: weave


template: software






## Weave.jl


Homework assignments will be written and compiled using `Weave.jl`.


  * `Weave.jl` is a package for literate programming which allows integration of text (Markdown) and code (Julia) in a single document.
  * Result can be easily compiled to HTML or a PDF.
  * We have an example code and document available.


---


name: github


template: software






## GitHub Classroom


Access to assignments will be through GitHub Classroom.


  * You will be given a link to create a repository when an assignment is released.
  * PDFs of assignments *should* be auto-compiled when you `git push`.
  * Makes it easy to share code for feedback and debugging.
  * Let's look at [an example repository](https://github.com/BEE4750/hw0)!

# Tips for Success


<hr>


  * Start assignments early!
  * Ask questions in class and on Ed and try to help your classmates
  * **Collaborate** &mdash; this is life as an engineer once you leave college!
  * But don't just copy, your work should reflect your own understanding.

# What Is A System?


<hr>


> A system is "an interconnected set of elements that is coherently organized in a way that achieves something...A system must consist of three kinds of things: *elements*, *interconnections* and *a function or purpose*."
>
> .cite[– Donella Meadows, *Thinking in Systems: A Primer*, 2008]

# What Is A System?


<hr>


In other words, **a system involves an interconnected set of components**, and analyzing a system involves **understanding the dynamics caused by those interconnections**.


For examples, systems might have:


  * amplifying or dampening feedbacks;
  * thresholds and bifurcations;
  * emergent dynamics.

  * *Components*: relevant processes, agents, etc


--


  * *Interconnections*: relationships between system components

  * *Control volume*: internal vs. external components


--


  * *Inputs*: control policies and/or external forcings

  * *Outputs*: measured quantities of interest

# System States


<hr>


We will repeatedly refer to the **state** of a system.


This is vague, but the state includes quantities or variables which evolve over time based on external inputs and system dynamics.

# Stocks and Flows


<hr>


Two additional important concepts in systems analysis are **stocks** and **flows**.


  * A **stock** is the amount of a system property: concentrations of a pollutant, numbers of currency units, etc.
  * A **flow** is the way in which a stock changes: decay, diffusion, production, consumption, etc.


Most systems analysis amounts to analyzing how flows across system interconnections impact stocks.


---


class: left






# Modeling System Flows


<hr>


For example:


  * Mass balance equations let us track changes in stocks at particular points;
  * Equilibrium conditions are requirements that there is no net flow, and thus that stocks are preserved;
  * Fate and transport modeling involves quantifying how stocks change as they move through the system.
