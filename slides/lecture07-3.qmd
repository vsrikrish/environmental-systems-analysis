# Lab 3 Instructions

## Forest Management Optimization

Your task in the lab: Formulate and solve a simple **resource allocation problem** (more on this next week).

Lab is due on 10/13 by 9pm.

## Reminder About The Rubric

For full points, make sure to check rubric (available on the Labs page of the website; Homework is similar) before finalizing submission. If unsure if something might be penalized, please ask on Ed or in class. In general, points will be taken off for:

* Missing units;
* Plots: Unlabeled axes/missing legends if needed;
* Lack of proper precision when reporting values.

# Upcoming Schedule

## Next Classes

**Monday**: No class (Indigeneous People's Day)

**Wednesday/Friday**: Linear Programming Examples (land allocation, power systems)

## Assessments

**Today**: Homework 3 due by 9:00pm.
